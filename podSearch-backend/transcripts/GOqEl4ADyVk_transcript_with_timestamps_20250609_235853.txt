==================================================

[00:00] I just felt like I was so addicted to
[00:02] this kind of false version of my life
[00:03] that it was just taking over and the
[00:05] thing that really upset me is the Press
[00:07] ran with that they were saying oh look
[00:09] he's not the perfect happy go-lucky kid
[00:11] you think he is he's having a nervous
[00:12] breakdown in New York if I was having a
[00:14] mental breakdown that's not for you to
[00:16] report on they took the story in the
[00:18] wrong direction and they kind of painted
[00:20] people looking for help in the wrong
[00:22] light the bestselling author and host
[00:24] the number one Health and Wellness
[00:26] podcast on purpose with j shett
[00:30] a lot of studies show that how we were
[00:32] loved or unloved between the ages of 0
[00:35] to five impact the next 15 25 50 years
[00:40] of our life Wow and how we give love to
[00:43] ourselves and how we give love to others
[00:45] and so I was thinking do you have a core
[00:47] memory or an experience with your family
[00:50] from childhood that kind of embodies the
[00:53] feeling you have about them now or that
[00:55] keeps you tied close to them I'd say
[00:57] sort of More Than A Memory is just a
[01:00] feeling that we I could say all of my
[01:02] brothers and I had was that because our
[01:04] dad's a comedian his job only ever
[01:09] existed once we had gone to bed and our
[01:11] mom worked from home she was a
[01:12] photographer so to us as kids our
[01:15] parents didn't really work they just
[01:17] were always home so we had this amazing
[01:20] Foundation where no matter any time of
[01:23] the day either mom or dad would be at
[01:24] the house and we felt so kind of solid
[01:27] as a family which is why like I kind of
[01:29] have this dream of one day having kids
[01:31] and putting my work to bed and just kind
[01:33] of being there as a dad cuz I really
[01:35] admire how my dad was around you know
[01:38] being a comedian is a very very volatile
[01:41] job the the highs and lows are so
[01:44] extreme and as kids we never saw that
[01:47] the only version of my dad I ever saw
[01:48] was the happy Dad let's go to the park
[01:51] we used to play this game called golf
[01:52] goals where we would go down to the park
[01:54] there's like this big blue metal goal
[01:56] and we would just fire golf balls into
[01:59] that go every day and he would give us
[02:01] 10 P every time a ball went in the goal
[02:04] and that was kind of the foundation of
[02:05] our Golf and and all that sort of stuff
[02:07] so for me broader than a core memory was
[02:10] the idea of always feeling connected and
[02:13] safe within my family unit and I think a
[02:16] large portion of that is that my mom and
[02:18] dad have always been such a solid team
[02:21] and they've always been there for us
[02:24] yeah wow have they as you've grown older
[02:26] have they kind of opened up about some
[02:27] of the challenges that they were going
[02:29] through that they obviously didn't show
[02:30] you and your family when you were kids
[02:32] because I can imagine we always talk
[02:34] about this right like being a comedian
[02:36] is extremely difficult because you're
[02:37] making everyone else laugh at the same
[02:39] time it's it's a career path that like
[02:41] you said is completely volatile sure
[02:44] have have they opened up as time's gone
[02:45] on and how has that felt when you've
[02:47] gone from like seeing your parents
[02:48] always being happy to being like Oh wait
[02:49] there was all this other stuff going on
[02:51] absolutely they have and and it's not
[02:53] even sometimes thing that they've told
[02:54] us it's just things that we've grown up
[02:56] to recognize as a young kid you know
[02:58] you're not looking to how's my mom
[03:00] feeling how's my dad feeling and now as
[03:02] an as an older person you know those are
[03:04] things I care about I want to call my
[03:05] mom cuz I know it will brighten her day
[03:08] so that's all part of growing up I guess
[03:11] so
[03:12] seeing the way in which my dad's job
[03:15] affects him or my dad's job affects my
[03:17] mom is something we've all sort of come
[03:20] to terms with and he's amazing at it I
[03:22] mean to be honest I say effect it
[03:24] doesn't really affect anyone he's so
[03:25] good at handling it and which is a lot
[03:27] of why I feel like I am the way I am am
[03:30] for example the crowded rooms come out
[03:32] the critics absolutely hated it they
[03:33] thought it was the worst thing they've
[03:34] ever seen and it doesn't really upset me
[03:37] and I think a large part of my feeling
[03:39] towards that has come from my dad being
[03:42] able to do a gig the gig not going well
[03:44] him brushing it off his shoulder and
[03:46] just right onto the next one yeah well
[03:48] and and first of all I want to point
[03:49] that out as well so I've been watching
[03:51] the crowded room right and me and my
[03:53] wife been watching it together and we
[03:54] are actually really enjoying it we're
[03:57] actually loving it because I love a show
[03:59] that has
[04:00] that's trying to like get me to figure
[04:02] it out and get me to think about I'm
[04:04] kind of confused and I love like that
[04:06] like I'm a massive Christopher Nolan fan
[04:09] all my favorite movies are Nolan movies
[04:10] and the reason why I love them is cuz I
[04:12] have no idea what's going on and that's
[04:14] you got to figure it out and you got to
[04:15] figure it out and I love puzzles and I
[04:16] love escape rooms and I love anything
[04:18] escape room yeah I love anything that's
[04:20] got me thinking what is going on here
[04:22] and why can't I figure it out mate do
[04:24] you know what you should watch I I
[04:26] admittedly watch it to go to sleep if
[04:27] I'm ever feeling stressed or like over
[04:29] stimulated
[04:30] I watch this guy called Chris Ramsey
[04:33] he's like a YouTube guy he's a magician
[04:35] but I just watch him solve puzzles he
[04:38] like buys these Japanese like
[04:41] handcrafted puzzle boxes and he just
[04:44] solves them and I've started buying them
[04:47] and they come to the house and you sit
[04:49] down for 4 hours put it down pick it up
[04:51] and try and solve this puzzle and it's
[04:54] amazing have you are you good at them no
[04:55] I'm terrible at them I'm absolutely
[04:57] terrible I've had an unsolved Rubik's
[04:59] Cube since I was at 11 but I um but yeah
[05:02] so I watch his videos cuz there's just
[05:03] something about like the sound of the
[05:05] wood I'm a carpenter so I love like
[05:09] craftsmanship and that sort of stuff so
[05:10] I love the way that these pieces are put
[05:12] together so watching him solve the
[05:14] puzzles I find so relaxing yeah I think
[05:16] for so many of us you know getting
[05:19] bad reviews
[05:22] perceptions people talking about us
[05:24] whatever that maybe whatever scale we
[05:26] live at can actually affect us and you
[05:28] saying that actually seeing dad letting
[05:31] him seeing him shrug it off and seeing
[05:32] him move on actually really helped him
[05:34] do you think that you've been able to
[05:36] create a bit more of a skill around that
[05:38] now or is it something that happens
[05:40] naturally for you because I'm I'm
[05:41] guessing that there's a lot of people
[05:42] who are listening and watching going Tom
[05:44] that's pretty amazing that you can do
[05:45] that at your scale and your level but
[05:48] you know I'm still affected by that or I
[05:50] really struggle when my mate says
[05:51] something like I know the number one
[05:53] thing I hear is like most people don't
[05:55] chase their dreams because they're
[05:56] scared of what their mates will say let
[05:58] alone what the world
[06:00] yeah I had this I was I was flying back
[06:02] last night as I was telling you so I was
[06:04] on a plane from DC to London last night
[06:06] and the air hostess she was wonderful
[06:08] and then was Janette she said to me she
[06:10] was like Jay I really want to start a
[06:11] YouTube channel but you know you just
[06:13] got to block out what your friends are
[06:14] GNA say right and she was just worried
[06:15] about so that it's a very real thing so
[06:18] I guess have you kind of figured out a
[06:19] little formula for it or is it just
[06:21] natural because you saw your dad and
[06:23] it's become easier that way I think it's
[06:24] a little bit of both really you know I
[06:27] think it's something you definitely get
[06:28] better at I'm really lucky that I have
[06:31] an
[06:31] incredibly strong group of friends like
[06:34] one of my best mates just called me up
[06:35] earlier to say he'd seen the fifth
[06:37] episode and it's like I know what
[06:39] happens in the show and I'm Still Loving
[06:41] It the people I'm watching it with have
[06:42] no idea what's going on but they can't
[06:44] wait for the next one yeah so you know I
[06:46] really really hold High the opinions of
[06:50] people that I really care about I'm also
[06:52] really lucky to have an amazing group of
[06:54] fans who are so supportive they are die
[06:56] hard they are there day one and that
[06:59] makes feel really good but I I do think
[07:01] a lot of my lessons in life have come
[07:03] from my dad and the ways that he can
[07:05] deal with things things that he hasn't
[07:07] done very well in the past that he's
[07:08] passed on to me
[07:11] and I sort of I live by this really I
[07:15] don't actually know if Christian Bale
[07:16] did say this but I I love Christian
[07:20] abely say he said it yeah but I think
[07:24] the quote is if you have a problem with
[07:26] me text me and if you don't have my
[07:28] number you don't know me well enough to
[07:30] have a problem with me that is so good
[07:32] and I think that that is such a great
[07:33] piece of advice because as a celebrity
[07:35] you live on this stage you live out
[07:38] there you kind of give out a version of
[07:40] yourself that you want people to see and
[07:44] that can be the version of yourself that
[07:45] they can have a problem with or they can
[07:47] love and there is a you know I feel like
[07:49] I'm quite authentic in my public persona
[07:53] but I just try to really care about what
[07:56] my family thinks what my friends think
[07:58] what the people in my local Community
[08:00] thing I live in Kingston I know everyone
[08:02] that lives there I can't walk 5 feet
[08:03] without bumping into one of my mom's
[08:05] friends so yeah so it's something I've
[08:07] been working on I try my best to not let
[08:10] that stuff affect me it does yeah of
[08:12] course I'm not cold-hearted or anything
[08:14] like that it does affect me but I just
[08:15] try to to move on and focus on the
[08:17] positives yeah absolutely absolutely
[08:19] what what was uh did you ever see your
[08:21] dad deal with everything and you thought
[08:22] wow that was incredible like was there
[08:24] anything specific that you remember that
[08:25] like seeing him like tackle something
[08:27] and you thought wow that really
[08:30] impressed me even if it was something
[08:31] really small in hindsight I think the
[08:33] thing I admire most about my dad is his
[08:36] resilience you know he's someone who has
[08:39] had an incredibly successful career in
[08:41] his earlier life and then later in life
[08:43] his career sort of plateaued and he
[08:45] struggled and he's never stopped he's
[08:48] never given up he's still gigging to
[08:50] this day he's still writing books he has
[08:52] a patron he has a podcast he's
[08:54] constantly grafting to get to where he
[08:56] wants to be and I think being a young
[08:59] kid and seeing your dad continually
[09:02] working as hard as he can to kind of put
[09:04] his best foot forward for me has been a
[09:07] huge drive for my work ethic I'll give
[09:09] it 100% or I'll give it nothing and I
[09:11] think a lot of that has come from my dad
[09:13] and seeing him deal with that the funny
[09:15] thing about my dad as he talk about
[09:16] doing a bad gig I must have seen him 20
[09:19] times I've never seen him do a bad gig
[09:21] he always seems to absolutely rip it um
[09:23] but maybe that's just cuz we're in the
[09:25] audience but he um but no I I I owe a
[09:28] lot to my dad and a lot of teachings are
[09:30] things he's told me and things I've just
[09:31] witnessed him do yeah and was there ever
[09:33] a piece of feedback or a rumor or
[09:35] something you saw that did affect you
[09:37] where you actually thought well or at
[09:39] least made you stop and go God I'm
[09:41] trying to see the positives but this
[09:42] one's tough like like this actually made
[09:46] me have to pause and figure it out
[09:49] something that did really upset me I was
[09:52] in New York I was shooting the crowded
[09:53] crowded
[09:54] room and I was having a really hard time
[09:57] with the job just because of how taxing
[09:59] it was the emotional capacity that I was
[10:01] having to get to every
[10:03] day
[10:04] and I decided to delete my Instagram
[10:07] because I just felt like I was so
[10:09] addicted to this kind of false version
[10:11] of my life that it was just taking over
[10:13] I would be on set working I'd come and
[10:15] sit in my chair and just scroll scroll
[10:16] scroll scroll scroll and it was it was
[10:18] becoming a problem I was just obsessed
[10:21] with it and I was obsessed to find out
[10:23] what people were saying and how people
[10:25] what they thought about me so I decided
[10:27] to make an announcement which
[10:29] unfortunately we have to do and say that
[10:31] I'm taking a break from social media and
[10:33] I and I try to position myself and say
[10:36] like I'm taking a break from social
[10:37] media because I feel like my mental
[10:38] health will benefit from it and the
[10:41] thing that really upset me is the Press
[10:42] ran with that and they tried to make out
[10:45] that I was having this mental breakdown
[10:48] and what upset me was if I was having a
[10:51] mental breakdown that's not for you to
[10:53] report on they they they took the story
[10:55] in the wrong direction and they Tred
[10:57] they painted again this negative on
[10:59] Mental Health rather than saying oh he's
[11:02] doing it it's okay that he's doing it so
[11:04] we should all feel okay to do it too
[11:06] they were saying oh look he's not the
[11:09] perfect happy go-lucky kid you think he
[11:10] is he's having a nervous breakdown in
[11:12] New York and I think that that was a
[11:14] really unfair line of Journalism let's
[11:17] say because I just think it again kind
[11:19] of painted
[11:22] people looking for help in the wrong
[11:24] light if you know what I mean yeah yeah
[11:26] absolutely absolutely it almost sounds
[11:28] like you were
[11:29] actually
[11:31] preemptively going I'm doing this so
[11:33] that I don't go in that direction
[11:36] totally at least I'm not trying to put
[11:37] words in your mouth but absolutely it's
[11:39] almost like I'm proactively seeing that
[11:41] I could end up in a position where sure
[11:43] I might have a breakdown I don't want to
[11:44] be in that position and so I'm
[11:46] responsibly saying guys I'm taking a
[11:48] break in order to protect myself 100%
[11:51] yeah which makes a lot of sense and
[11:52] actually is quite admirable again
[11:54] totally and that's kind of what the
[11:55] message of the show is about like the
[11:57] the message of our show is that asking
[11:58] for help should be something that we
[12:00] celebrate if you're struggling if you
[12:02] need help if you feel bad and you wake
[12:05] up and and you go to a friend a
[12:07] therapist a teacher an employee or a
[12:09] colleague and say I'm really struggling
[12:11] I need some help that should be
[12:13] something that we give you a pat on the
[12:14] back like I would love to help you that
[12:16] I'm I'm delighted that you asked me and
[12:19] that for me that announcement was kind
[12:21] of my Olive Branch and the Press ran
[12:25] with it how they ran with it but to be
[12:27] fair it kind of gave me a great drive to
[12:30] finish the crowded room in the way that
[12:32] we did to like if you're not going to
[12:34] listen to my personal message then you
[12:36] have to listen to the message of my show
[12:38] yeah so it kind of went hand in hand
[12:39] yeah yeah absolutely you you've reminded
[12:41] me actually when when you said that
[12:43] because I think we naturally today think
[12:45] of therapists or or doctors but you you
[12:48] mentioned teacher there and I was
[12:49] thinking when I was going through a
[12:50] really rough time at school once I
[12:52] remember my walk to school from the bus
[12:55] stop I'd see a teacher every day that
[12:57] was really close with that school but
[12:58] you never talk to teachers walk School
[13:02] crazy but I was so lonely at the time
[13:04] that I remember like almost thinking
[13:05] like well he's the only person I can
[13:07] talk to because of other stuff that I
[13:09] was going through at school and I
[13:10] remember I started talking to him on the
[13:12] way to school his name is Mr bucker he
[13:14] knows I go on about him everywhere and
[13:16] he avoids it because everyone's always
[13:18] like oh Jay's been talking about you J
[13:20] been talking about you and but it was it
[13:21] was that exact feeling where it was like
[13:23] he was someone that I felt I could open
[13:24] to that open up to at that point in my
[13:26] life without feeling judged without
[13:27] feeling like he was going to see me
[13:29] through another lens and just having
[13:31] that space to be seen for as a human who
[13:34] is going through stufft by a teacher was
[13:37] a huge huge win and so you know it's you
[13:39] are right that that help can come in all
[13:42] different forms and it does it doesn't
[13:44] have to come in the ways that we
[13:44] expected to come in yeah it doesn't have
[13:46] to be a professional yeah I go to my
[13:48] friends a lot and and you know some
[13:51] friends are better than others in
[13:52] certain situations I got some friends
[13:53] that are very much like pull your socks
[13:55] up and get on with it and then other
[13:56] friends who are like come here and have
[13:58] a cry on my shoulder but like it it
[14:00] varies so I just really hope that that's
[14:02] what the show can do is is sort of paint
[14:05] this positive picture of asking for help
[14:07] is something to be proud of well that's
[14:08] a great message and and I think we we
[14:10] all need to hear it and I want to go
[14:12] back a little bit because there's a lot
[14:13] of interviews that you've done and and
[14:14] I've watched a lot of stuff over the
[14:16] time but like we're talking about a lot
[14:17] of it sound bites because it's quick and
[14:18] short and like these entertainment you
[14:20] know interviews and that's why I was
[14:22] really grateful that you took out the
[14:23] time to do this but you were diagnosed
[14:25] as far as I read with dyslexia age seven
[14:28] yes and I was wondering how you know a
[14:31] lot of our community and our audience is
[14:33] diagnosed as well or some of them are
[14:34] not but they're finding out later on in
[14:36] life how did that affect you or how were
[14:38] you set up for success with that from
[14:40] because as an actor you've got to learn
[14:42] lines you got to read lines there's a
[14:43] lot of activities that people would
[14:45] assume are quite challenging sure but
[14:47] you found a way and and walk us through
[14:49] that a little bit I don't know I had my
[14:51] mom has always been really Hands-On with
[14:52] our education MH she you know really
[14:56] wanted us to just do our best our dad
[14:58] always said like look I don't don't care
[14:59] what grades you get as long as you try
[15:00] your best you try your best and that's
[15:02] all that we can ask for but yeah my
[15:05] dyslexia it's really just my spelling I
[15:08] mean honestly it's just that yeah you
[15:10] know like those sort of games that you
[15:11] play at Christmas have you ever played
[15:13] um the one you have to write down the
[15:15] answers that it's it's such a good game
[15:17] is it boulder dash I don't know boulder
[15:18] dash is it uh it's basically a game
[15:20] where someone will read out a scenario
[15:22] or um ask a question and then you have
[15:25] to answer the question to the best of
[15:27] your ability but you can also Bluff and
[15:29] lie oh I've never played this game and
[15:31] if you write somewhat a believing answer
[15:33] and people vote for your answer you win
[15:35] oh cool okay I've never played it which
[15:37] is great but when I play it everyone's
[15:39] like what does that say that is
[15:42] definitely not spelled right um but yeah
[15:45] so my spelling was really the biggest
[15:47] hurdle um I worked really hard at school
[15:49] I didn't do particularly well but again
[15:52] my parents said as long as you try your
[15:54] best then that's all we can ask for yeah
[15:55] and acting you started early too age
[15:57] nine right like that was something that
[15:59] you started P pursuing really early on
[16:01] in life and I feel was that something
[16:02] that you were always sure about there's
[16:04] that there's that famous viral Tik Tok
[16:06] that always goes around of you you know
[16:08] I can't I don't know how old you were
[16:09] being asked you know what superhero
[16:11] would you play when you're older you say
[16:13] oh maybe Spider-Man right and it's like
[16:15] and and I wonder like how much of your
[16:19] acting career do you feel like you've
[16:21] manifested or there was a vision or a
[16:23] focus or is it more just like this was
[16:25] naturally what you were into and it and
[16:26] it grew where where did that come from I
[16:28] do believe in manifesting actually I
[16:30] really do I think what's interesting
[16:31] about my career is this was never
[16:33] something I wanted I just was a young
[16:36] kid I love dancing my mom would take me
[16:39] to a dance class every Saturday and I
[16:42] got spotted through that dance class to
[16:44] to audition for a show on the West End I
[16:45] ended up doing the show I loved it Billy
[16:48] Elliott it was the time of my life I you
[16:50] know it was such a cool experience I'm
[16:53] just by complete fluke an agent came to
[16:55] see the show the night that I was on she
[16:58] signed me she sent me to an audition for
[17:00] a film I was lucky enough to get the
[17:02] part all of a sudden I was on set with
[17:04] you McGregor and Naomi Watts and we made
[17:06] the
[17:07] impossible and to be perfectly honest
[17:10] with you it was it was just a hobby it
[17:13] was something that my mom would let me
[17:14] do on the summer holidays she was very
[17:16] keen that I kept my schooling up and
[17:18] there sort of came that time in England
[17:19] where you in between gcc's and a levels
[17:22] and you're trying to figure out when I
[17:24] was going through that you could still
[17:25] drop out at a levels obviously now you
[17:28] have to do a levels
[17:29] and I had that moment where I was like
[17:32] what do I want to do I could try and
[17:34] stay at school and figure out what I
[17:36] want to do or this thing that's been a
[17:38] hobby but my sort of summer holiday
[17:40] activity which is acting I could try and
[17:42] do that for a living and I've been so
[17:44] lucky that I've been you know offered
[17:46] jobs and all that sort of stuff I
[17:48] decided to go with it I I I joined the
[17:50] Brit school because you know my mom was
[17:52] Keen that I didn't go for school for an
[17:54] education but went to school to expand
[17:57] my social skills and meet kids my own
[17:59] age all my friends when I was 15 were
[18:02] like 30y old people cuz they're all
[18:04] adults from the business um so I think
[18:06] my mom was Keen that I had some friends
[18:08] that are my age who are now my best
[18:09] friends today so I never really wanted
[18:12] this I just sort of never stopped doing
[18:15] it and I love it I absolutely love it I
[18:17] love the creativity I love the building
[18:19] blocks that are required to put a film
[18:21] together I love the collaboration on set
[18:24] between people from all different walks
[18:26] of life you know a film set is a Melting
[18:28] Pot of all sort of different people um
[18:31] so I love it I absolutely love it yeah
[18:33] wow and and I I read something that you
[18:34] said you were bullied for like doing
[18:37] ballet yeah ear which obviously got you
[18:39] into the playing the role of Billy ell
[18:42] because it's ballet and tap right it's
[18:43] both so was was that was that tough at
[18:46] the time or like were you trying to hide
[18:47] it and then you end up on you know you
[18:49] end up at the West End and you're on the
[18:50] main stage and everyone's seeing it or
[18:52] was it kind of easy to navigate and how
[18:54] did that go down because I feel like as
[18:56] a kid doing ballet and tap must have
[18:58] been a little challenging yeah I mean it
[19:00] was it wasn't easy but it also wasn't
[19:03] tough you know I went to a rugby school
[19:05] so you can imagine like the one kid in
[19:08] the school that does ballet there's
[19:10] going to be comments here and there it
[19:12] wasn't the easiest thing in the world
[19:13] there were kids that didn't understand
[19:15] why I was doing it or what I was doing
[19:17] it for no matter how many times I
[19:18] explained like I'm the only guy in a
[19:20] class of 30 girls in tights I was like
[19:22] guys this is what you want to be doing
[19:24] like rugby is not it but I N it was
[19:27] tough but again like goes back to what
[19:29] we were saying about resilience and and
[19:31] keeping your head down and crowded room
[19:33] was the hardest job I've ever had for
[19:35] all sorts of different reasons and there
[19:37] was a point in time where we were
[19:38] talking about do we shut this down and
[19:41] walk away from it because of how
[19:43] challenging it was and you know I dug my
[19:45] heels in I put my head down I was like
[19:47] no I'm going to finish this I'm going to
[19:48] see it through and I think you know you
[19:50] learn from past experiences like that so
[19:52] I really am proud of the way we everyone
[19:54] handled the crowded room and I think
[19:56] that stems from my childhood my dad
[19:58] experiences and all that sort of stuff
[20:00] yeah well so I've got a confession as
[20:02] well to mate go on so I went to rugby
[20:04] school as well okay and did you I played
[20:07] yeah I played for my a team and I was I
[20:08] was pretty good pretty good I was pretty
[20:10] good okay what position did you play
[20:12] Blindside flanker okay wow so I was I
[20:14] was really into rugby because I went to
[20:16] rugby school and I loved football but my
[20:18] school didn't play football and so I was
[20:20] like no I've got to be on the school's
[20:21] main team so worked really hard to get
[20:23] on the team but after we play rugby on a
[20:26] Saturday my mom forced me to go to
[20:29] dance class and part of it was ballet
[20:31] and tap as well although I did not end
[20:33] up at the West End and play Billy Elliot
[20:35] because I don't think Billy Elliott was
[20:36] brown so that that wasn't going to
[20:38] happen so it wasn't the same path as you
[20:41] but but I also had that experience so
[20:43] that's why I had to ask you about did
[20:44] you enjoy it I really enjoyed it for the
[20:46] community aspect of it like I love all
[20:48] the lads that I was there with and they
[20:49] were just they were just a great laugh
[20:50] and it was really interesting because
[20:51] we'd go from I'd literally go from
[20:53] playing rugby straight to class on a
[20:56] Saturday and I'd go in there with all my
[20:57] bruises exhausted
[21:00] just and it's almost like the rug pitch
[21:03] was moreful everyone you know try to be
[21:06] intense and trying to be this and that
[21:07] whereas everyone just having a laugh at
[21:09] the dance class and we do everything
[21:10] from hip-hop to Street to whatever but
[21:13] yeah I remember never telling I think
[21:15] this the first time I've ever spoken
[21:16] about out there I'm in a safe space with
[21:18] you so but it's interesting because
[21:20] Rugby's regimented isn't it yeah I love
[21:23] by you play you play a position that is
[21:25] as specific as saying the blid side
[21:27] flanker you when you're a dancer you're
[21:29] just a dancer you know you you can fit
[21:32] in however you want to fit in the
[21:33] teacher can ask you how are you feeling
[21:35] about that rather than like you need to
[21:37] get your head down to the left to make a
[21:38] proper tackle I did love playing rugby
[21:41] when I was smaller yeah when all the
[21:43] well not when I was smaller when all the
[21:44] kids were smaller and then there was
[21:46] that time where I came back to school
[21:48] after Billy Elliott and everyone had
[21:49] just become a man and I was still very
[21:52] much a child I remember we played this
[21:54] school called Trinity College and it was
[21:56] my first game back and I was playing
[21:58] scrum I came on the second half and it
[22:00] was a violent game it was not it was not
[22:03] a gentleman's game of rugby and I was
[22:06] standing they were kicking to us we were
[22:08] receiving and I remember thinking as
[22:09] long as the ball doesn't come to me off
[22:11] of the kick I'll be fine I need the game
[22:13] to get going and then I'll be fine I'm
[22:14] scrum half relatively safe position I'm
[22:16] a good playmaker as soon as he kicked
[22:19] the ball it's coming straight towards me
[22:22] I I'm trying to catch it I can hear the
[22:23] boots running towards me I fumble it
[22:25] knock on the game goes on I start
[22:28] playing play well I assisted a try and
[22:31] then I don't remember what happened or
[22:33] how it happened but there was a a really
[22:36] tough kid on our team who will remain
[22:38] nameless I haven't spoken to him since I
[22:40] don't know what he's doing but he got
[22:41] into a fight with some kid on the
[22:43] opposing team and it was really quite
[22:45] ugly and then the kid's dad came on the
[22:48] pitch to tell off this boy that was on
[22:51] my team and the kid on my team knocked
[22:53] out his dad no like proper like it's the
[22:56] first time I've ever seen someone hit
[22:57] someone and I couldn't believe that a
[23:00] kid who was how old are you yeah he must
[23:02] have been 16 at the time he's one of
[23:04] those 16 year olds that would look older
[23:06] than I do now when he was 16 and I just
[23:09] remember hearing the noise he like
[23:12] cracked this Dad on the jaw Hit the
[23:13] Floor then this whole big fight broke
[23:15] out I'm not a fighter I stepped away and
[23:17] was sort of like what's going
[23:18] on yeah it was wild and that was the
[23:20] last game of rugby I ever played it was
[23:22] against Trinity College oh my gosh yeah
[23:24] it was really intense wow that that is
[23:26] intense yeah that's how intense it got
[23:28] my last game was similar but not not
[23:31] watching a fight so someone ran I had it
[23:34] was a big game and it I was playing
[23:36] really well that season and everything
[23:38] was going really well and someone ran
[23:41] into a rock but with their elbow which
[23:43] is obviously ilal totally they ran in
[23:45] and they elbowed me right there like
[23:48] right Bel it's on this side and right
[23:50] below there and the next thing I know I
[23:52] get up and I'm like kind of feeling a
[23:54] bit aggressive are you cut as well well
[23:56] I didn't notice and then Blood starts to
[23:57] drip and I was like that's when you
[23:59] freak out cuz oh God I'm I'm like I can
[24:01] and there's a lot of blood just dripping
[24:03] so I get subbed off and the nurse on the
[24:07] side just puts a bit of glue there like
[24:08] to stick it together and at the mo at
[24:11] that time you don't really notice in you
[24:13] think you're all right and then
[24:14] literally an hour later it's just
[24:15] getting thicker and thicker and thicker
[24:17] and I'm ending up with this run to the
[24:18] hospital on the way home because my
[24:20] coach was just like suck it up it's fine
[24:21] you'll be fine run there they're like if
[24:23] you were any later you would have had
[24:25] nerve damage and like personally
[24:27] potentially eyesight whatever it was and
[24:29] they had to like glue it and a little
[24:31] bit of stitches or whatever it was and I
[24:33] for the for the rest of the month I
[24:35] walked around with my like you know eye
[24:37] literally hanging over and I looked like
[24:39] I'd got into like the worst fight like I
[24:40] walked into a store and everyone would
[24:42] kind of back off and stuff and it was
[24:43] just really uncomfortable that was my
[24:45] last game of rugby that's why I just
[24:46] remembered that but yeah it was it was
[24:48] it was it was intense but it was great
[24:51] like you said it was great regimented
[24:53] discipline training I love training with
[24:54] my mates I love playing I loved as a
[24:56] young man as well like having a outlet
[24:58] to release the energy that I had I was
[25:02] good in in obviously in a way that
[25:04] wasn't trying to hurt others but that's
[25:05] what's so great about boxing yeah it's
[25:07] like boxing is such a great release you
[25:09] know you see these young kids like young
[25:10] kids who are angry who need to let
[25:12] something go like go and punch a bag for
[25:14] an hour but that will make you that will
[25:15] calm you down I love how boxing is such
[25:18] a great thing for young for young people
[25:20] to to release that sort of ENT are you
[25:22] boxing do you box I love boxing it's
[25:24] been a few years since I've I've done
[25:25] any sort of training I used to go to
[25:27] this great gym in um in New York called
[25:30] Church Street boxing just love it there
[25:32] had a great Pro you could sort of spar
[25:34] with him because you know that he
[25:36] wouldn't batter you because he could
[25:37] control himself I went to one sparring
[25:39] session just a general session and I got
[25:43] absolutely
[25:44] batter yeah it was tough but I love it I
[25:47] love the sport I'm a little bit sad as
[25:49] to like how the sport is being run right
[25:51] now right um but I do love the sport and
[25:54] I admire the athletes I think they're
[25:55] amazing what's your take on YouTubers
[25:56] boxing and all that kind of stuff and
[25:59] because it's obviously bringing a lot of
[26:00] attention to the sport to be perfectly
[26:02] honest with you I don't really mind it I
[26:04] think it's quite fun I think if you're
[26:05] doing it for the right reasons you know
[26:07] there's a great opportunity to raise
[26:08] some money for amazing Charities and I
[26:10] think a few of them have done a lot for
[26:11] charity um I think it's really great I
[26:13] think yeah you know my brother Paddy
[26:15] would never have been watching boxing
[26:17] and now he loves it because of his
[26:19] favorite Youtubers of boxing so if it's
[26:22] good for the sport it's good for the
[26:23] sport I I sort of don't really mind I
[26:26] think it's funny to be honest yeah cuz
[26:28] sit at home watching it you're like I
[26:29] could do that I could get in there and
[26:30] do that you're like well why don't you
[26:32] and you're like well I don't really want
[26:33] to do that so we might see you in Creed
[26:36] Ford then yeah we'll do the we'll do the
[26:39] acting boxing I'd love to do a boxing
[26:41] movie yeah I think it would be cool to
[26:43] do a boxing movie but where the fighting
[26:45] is
[26:46] real walk me through that I wouldn't
[26:48] necessarily be in that film right but I
[26:50] do think that you could make a really
[26:52] interesting film where the outcome of
[26:54] the film is determined on the outcome of
[26:57] the real fight has anything like that
[26:59] ever been done like racing or any can
[27:02] you I'm just trying to not that I know
[27:04] of yeah not that I know of that's what
[27:05] I'm trying to think it could be really
[27:07] cool yeah wow but yeah I love I love
[27:09] boxing movies I'm a sucker for it yeah
[27:11] yeah which one's which which one's your
[27:13] favorite I think Rocky 2 is probably my
[27:15] favorite I remember when we were in
[27:17] Billy Elliott we had this room called
[27:18] the Billy room and there was always a
[27:20] billy backstage while the show was going
[27:22] on because the show was so labor
[27:23] intensive it was very dangerous there's
[27:25] lots of moving Parts there's lots of
[27:26] acrobatics it wasn't too uncommon for a
[27:29] billy to get injured and then there
[27:30] would be someone upstairs who would
[27:31] replace that Billy and we would just
[27:34] hang out upstairs and there was an Xbox
[27:35] and a television and all that sort of
[27:37] stuff and one of the DVDs that we had
[27:39] the two DVDs we had was step up to the
[27:41] streets my favorite film of all time and
[27:43] Rocky too and I've must have seen that
[27:45] film 40 times I love how many times did
[27:47] you practice the dance in the mirror oh
[27:49] man I've got the whole dance down righto
[27:51] can we see it
[27:53] no yeah no I love that film I absolutely
[27:56] love that film yeah i' say I say my
[27:58] favorite so Rocky was my favorite cuz
[27:59] I'd watch it with my dad and
[28:02] Rocky I I struggled between Rocky 3 and
[28:05] Rocky four cuz I loved Mr T and three
[28:08] that's three and I loved Ivan Drago as
[28:10] well which was four and they were both
[28:11] just such great movies yeah yeah yeah he
[28:14] was just yeah it's such great
[28:16] entertainment even though it's nothing
[28:17] like real boxing yeah nothing at all
[28:19] nothing like real boxing but then I
[28:21] remember watching real boxing when I was
[28:22] growing up it was Prince Nim oh man yeah
[28:25] yeah my dad was a big fan of his so I'd
[28:26] remember watching him a lot love his
[28:28] style there's a video of him working
[28:31] with the I guess he's just it's like a
[28:33] swinging bag and he is so effortless
[28:36] because canelo's got a great head
[28:37] movement but but he looks like he's
[28:38] thinking about it yeah whereas nazim is
[28:41] just living the dream just he's so fluid
[28:44] and I love the way he used to move yeah
[28:47] and I love how he would enter the ring
[28:49] me I would over rotate and slam on my
[28:52] face or something yeah he was brilliant
[28:53] yeah he was like wrestling meets
[28:55] boxing he must have been a nightmare to
[28:57] fight it must have been like he's
[28:59] beating me and he's embarrassing me this
[29:01] is really tough terrible what do you
[29:03] think of lenko did you see his last
[29:05] fight I haven't no I didn't see it I
[29:06] didn't see it that's an interesting one
[29:08] go and tell me I I didn't see it at all
[29:10] well I think the general consensus is
[29:11] that he won oh but it was given the
[29:14] other way right he is my favorite boxer
[29:17] because of his history his background in
[29:19] dance he was like I guess a really
[29:21] talented boxer and then I guess I don't
[29:23] know if this is true but his dad sent
[29:24] him to go and study dance for sort of
[29:26] five years or something like that for
[29:28] his boxing for his boxing which is why
[29:30] his footwork is like on another planet
[29:32] there's loads of examples of where he's
[29:33] fighting people and they look up and
[29:35] he's just gone he's behind them so I I
[29:38] really admire him but his most recent
[29:40] fight he lost how did it go against him
[29:42] was it a vote it was a vote right right
[29:45] they went against him so I wonder
[29:47] whether they'll fight again yeah I guess
[29:49] they'll have to if there's it seems like
[29:51] this isn't a conspiracy theory that's
[29:53] the problem with boxing though like will
[29:54] they fight again you know because it's
[29:57] it's a tricky it's a tricky business
[29:58] unlike the UFC where you know if they
[29:59] want to fight they'll fight that's what
[30:01] I love about it I took my brother and my
[30:02] cousin to the UFC the other night
[30:06] and that is such a Savage sport it is
[30:10] that is yeah it's terrifying I really
[30:13] don't want that to be a movie in a real
[30:14] one seen the warrior my m movie so good
[30:18] the warrior is one of the most
[30:19] underrated movies it's so good yeah it's
[30:22] a little ridiculous the idea that they
[30:23] have like six fights a night getting
[30:25] ready for one final but I do love that
[30:28] film yeah yeah yeah it's a really good
[30:30] it's a really good movie oh well okay
[30:31] all right so we know there's a boxing
[30:32] movie coming somewhere down L got be one
[30:34] down the line there's got to be one down
[30:35] the line absolutely yeah and we want to
[30:37] see you work your way up and uh fig you
[30:40] I mean we might see you like you know
[30:42] actually go do it for real sounds
[30:44] imagine for charity maybe one of the
[30:46] things that you mentioned recently was
[30:48] that you gave up drinking about a year
[30:50] and a half ago yes and you said it was
[30:52] the hardest thing you ever did yes and I
[30:55] wanted to know what was so hard about it
[30:57] for you why was it so hard it's
[30:59] interesting I I didn't one day wake up
[31:02] and say I'm giving up drinking I just
[31:06] like many bricks had had a very very
[31:07] boozy December Christmas time I was on
[31:10] vacation I was drinking a lot and I've
[31:13] always been able to drink a lot I think
[31:15] I get my jeans from my mom's side in
[31:17] that thing that I can I can drink and I
[31:19] decided to just give up for January I
[31:21] just wanted to do dry January and all I
[31:25] could think about was having a drink
[31:27] it's all I could think about about I was
[31:29] waking up thinking about it I was
[31:30] checking the clock when's it
[31:32] 12: and it just really scared me I just
[31:35] was like wow maybe maybe I have a little
[31:37] bit of an alcohol thing so I sort of
[31:40] decided to punish myself and say I'll do
[31:42] February as well I'll do two months off
[31:44] if I can do two months off then I can
[31:46] prove to myself that I don't have a
[31:48] problem two months go by and I was still
[31:51] really struggling I felt like I couldn't
[31:54] be social I felt like I couldn't go to
[31:56] the pub and have a lime soda
[31:58] I couldn't go out for dinner I was
[32:00] really really struggling and I started
[32:02] to really worry that maybe I had an
[32:05] alcohol problem um so I decided that I
[32:08] would wait until my birthday which is
[32:09] June 1st I said to myself if I can do
[32:12] six months without alcohol then I can
[32:14] prove to myself that I don't have a
[32:15] problem and by the time I had got to
[32:18] June 1st I was the happiest I'd ever
[32:21] been in my life I could sleep better I
[32:24] could handle problems better things that
[32:26] would go wrong on set that would
[32:28] normally set me off I could take in my
[32:29] stride I had so much such better mental
[32:33] Clarity I felt healthier I felt fitter
[32:37] and I just sort of said to myself like
[32:39] why why am I enslaved to this drink why
[32:43] am I so obsessed by the idea of having
[32:44] this drink and I would look back and
[32:46] recognize that I would go to events for
[32:48] for work and I can't enjoy myself until
[32:51] I've had a few
[32:52] beers and I just felt so much pressure
[32:56] and this is one of the things why I've
[32:57] sort of dist myself from the rugby
[32:59] community cuzz so much of it is about
[33:01] how much can you drink let's get you as
[33:02] drunk as possible and it's honestly been
[33:05] the best thing I've ever done I'm a year
[33:07] and a half into it now it doesn't even
[33:10] cross my mind I found amazing
[33:12] Replacements that I think are fantastic
[33:15] ones that are also really healthy I
[33:17] found this one beer that it's full of
[33:19] electrolytes and it's you know the carbo
[33:21] hydrates in it a longlasting energy so
[33:23] like having a beer is now actually like
[33:25] a really healthy thing I'm really lucky
[33:27] that all my friends are super supportive
[33:28] about it I've never run into that
[33:30] scenario where my friends are like oh go
[33:31] on just have a beer like you're fine
[33:33] they've always sort of really supported
[33:35] me and I don't want to be that person
[33:37] that's saying to people you should get
[33:39] sober you should get sober if I could
[33:41] encourage someone to drink less then
[33:43] that's great but I I don't want to start
[33:45] getting into the world of you need to
[33:47] stop drinking because I just it's it's
[33:48] not for me to say I went on my own
[33:50] little journey I'm really enjoying it
[33:52] I'm delighted that my mom's has also
[33:54] given up she's loving it and it's been
[33:56] amazing I can't believe the difference
[33:58] that I feel from not drinking I feel
[34:00] amazing that's amazing man I love
[34:02] hearing that and I love hearing that
[34:03] it's been great for you right I think
[34:04] that's that's the point not everything
[34:06] has to be like look what I did you can
[34:07] do it too it's kind of like no this is
[34:09] just what's been great for me do you
[34:10] think it was partly that attitude for
[34:13] you at least in the beginning where it's
[34:14] like well look I can drink I drink a lot
[34:16] it comes from my mom jeans and it
[34:17] doesn't affect me and then all of a
[34:18] sudden you realize well wait a minute
[34:20] it's more than that because I think
[34:22] there is that like I was like that as a
[34:24] young man as well like for me it was it
[34:25] was easy to drink I I didn't drink daily
[34:27] for me I drank a lot more socially and I
[34:30] love playing drinking games with my
[34:31] mates that was really what I enjoyed the
[34:33] most probably and for me when I quit I
[34:36] could just quickly see how it just got
[34:39] me into doing things I would never do if
[34:40] I wasn't drunk so for me for me it was
[34:42] more that but yeah I wonder for you did
[34:44] you find that it's there's a really fine
[34:46] line between like I know I can drink a
[34:48] lot and then all of a sudden you're kind
[34:50] of addict not addicted beyond that no
[34:51] addicted M I'm happy to say like I was
[34:53] definitely addicted to alcohol not shy
[34:56] away from that at all I think anyone
[34:58] that wakes up and has a not wakes up
[34:59] anyone that has a beer every day is
[35:01] probably got a little bit of a problem
[35:03] but yeah you're right I I would drink
[35:05] and drink and drink and drink and then
[35:06] you would just reach that moment where
[35:08] you're like wow I shouldn't have had
[35:09] that last beer and you wake up the next
[35:10] day and you have a terrible headache and
[35:12] you're suffering I I bought one of those
[35:14] rings that will tell you about your
[35:15] sleep yeah Aura ring yeah and it was
[35:17] amazing cuz I couldn't sleep I was like
[35:19] why can't I sleep I'm working 14 hours a
[35:21] day I'm doing two hours in the gym I'm
[35:23] eating really healthily and I can't
[35:24] sleep what's wrong with me I bought this
[35:26] ring and it was booze it just it was
[35:29] completely affecting my sleep and since
[35:31] I've given it up I can sleep anywhere
[35:33] you know it's also interesting as well
[35:35] going on nights out and having a great
[35:37] time as the sober person and then
[35:40] getting to that point in the night where
[35:41] people start you know spitting in your
[35:43] ear and everyone's I love you man I love
[35:46] you so much and you're like yeah
[35:47] brilliant I love you too I'll see you
[35:48] tomorrow I'm going to bed I love being
[35:50] that person now I love seeing my friends
[35:53] on the golf course at 8:00 a.m. in the
[35:54] morning feeling fresh and ready to go
[35:57] and sort of crawling out their car and
[36:00] so yeah so I I I'm over the moon to be
[36:03] sober I love it yeah for anyone who is
[36:05] listening right now is going Tom I love
[36:08] that for you I want to do it too like
[36:09] they're listening going I'm having too
[36:11] much every day I can notice some of
[36:13] those things but I'm just stuck and it's
[36:15] hard because we know that addiction's
[36:17] that way we know that this is heavy it's
[36:18] not easy but if someone is watching
[36:20] going Tom tell me like what what did you
[36:22] do to even get started how did you have
[36:24] that courage to say I'm going to do
[36:26] January I'm going to stick at it were
[36:28] there any moments where you actually
[36:29] fell back and then had to get back on
[36:30] the horse again like just walk us
[36:32] through that a little bit more for
[36:33] anyone who is watching going Tom mate I
[36:35] I want to be in your position in like
[36:36] six months I didn't fall back on it I
[36:39] have done in the past like I've had
[36:42] periods of my life where I'd given up
[36:43] drinking and then gone back to drinking
[36:45] um but this
[36:47] time I don't know it was just different
[36:51] I really worked to sort of change my
[36:53] mindset I really asked myself like why
[36:55] do you drink why are you drinking and a
[36:57] lot of the time my answer would be to
[36:59] feel more comfortable in the social
[37:00] environment yeah and I just put myself
[37:05] in those environments and just would
[37:06] force myself to be there I'd force
[37:08] myself to hang out and and go to a club
[37:10] or go to a bar go to a dinner yeah we
[37:12] weren't avoiding those places I was at
[37:14] the beginning because I didn't feel like
[37:15] I could go and not have a drink because
[37:17] of the stress of it but then after a
[37:19] while I sort of was like mate youve got
[37:20] to pull your socks up here and you can't
[37:22] just live in your house all the time
[37:23] you've got to go out and enjoy yourself
[37:25] and and if you're only enjoying yourself
[37:27] because you're drink drinking then you
[37:28] really do have a problem but I just
[37:29] changed my mindset I just I found really
[37:32] good replacements things that I could
[37:35] sort of attribute to having a beer I
[37:37] often found with me most of it is just
[37:40] the ritual of cracking something open
[37:42] and sharing it with friends and drinking
[37:44] it whether it's sparkling water or a
[37:46] beer I now can't I don't associate like
[37:49] I don't see a difference yeah but I
[37:51] think it's different for everyone I had
[37:52] a great support system Jack is one of my
[37:54] best mates and we travel all over the
[37:55] world he doesn't drink and do with him
[37:58] was was a really helpful experience for
[38:00] me my brother is always on the road with
[38:02] me he was very supportive and yeah I
[38:05] just really set my mind to it I was I
[38:06] really want to do this I want to prove
[38:07] to myself I can do it yeah and then once
[38:09] I'd felt the health benefits and started
[38:11] really feeling like my full self like oh
[38:15] my God this is this is the best but do
[38:17] you not drink I haven't drank for 17
[38:19] years no way congratulations that's
[38:21] aming I feel amazing yeah it it's
[38:23] incredible wow it's like one of the best
[38:25] feelings in the world and it's my my
[38:27] biggest like worry when I was about to
[38:29] quit was like how am I going to hang out
[38:30] with my mates biggest worry I was like
[38:32] my mates knew me as the guy who was like
[38:34] first to the game L to get out like that
[38:37] was me you know the clown when I got
[38:38] drunk like life of the party kind of
[38:40] like that kind of guy and then all of a
[38:41] sudden I I decided I wasn't going to
[38:43] drink anymore I was like crap am I going
[38:45] to fit in and then I remember I went
[38:46] into the corporate world for a bit and I
[38:48] didn't drink and I was like God am I
[38:50] going to miss out on like opportunities
[38:51] and networking like you know all the
[38:53] guys afterwards are like going to get
[38:55] drinks and I'm like I'll come but I'll
[38:56] have a water or have a soda whatever it
[38:58] is and what was really interesting for
[39:00] me is not relying on Drinking Made Me
[39:05] rely on qualities and skills I had sure
[39:08] that were actually better so now that I
[39:11] couldn't drink as an excuse to hang with
[39:13] the lads I was bringing out parts of my
[39:15] personality that I probably would have
[39:16] just hidden awayed yeah suppressed and
[39:19] all of a sudden you were actually
[39:21] getting respected and liked for who you
[39:22] were rather than the person who you were
[39:24] when you were drunk sure and and
[39:26] actually that worked in the work place
[39:27] and there was no one at the workplace
[39:28] going oh Jay doesn't drink so he's not
[39:30] getting promoted it wasn't like that
[39:31] people were like oh yeah I really like
[39:32] hanging out with Jay or's he's a really
[39:34] good guy or whatever it may be and I was
[39:36] still getting the same opportunities and
[39:37] I was still getting promoted at work and
[39:39] whatever it was and I think that's why
[39:41] I'd like to remind people that don't
[39:43] feel like your career or your work is
[39:45] going to suffer even for you like you've
[39:47] I'm sure as a you know with your career
[39:50] path you have to be at parties you have
[39:51] to be at events and the fact that you're
[39:53] able to do that now without having
[39:55] alcohol and you it doesn't sound like
[39:57] it's negatively impacting your career if
[39:59] anything it's the opposite mate I
[40:01] honestly cannot believe like the amount
[40:03] of times I've sat down with an actor
[40:04] that I really admired or sat down with a
[40:06] producer or director and being like Oh
[40:08] you know well I don't drink anymore and
[40:09] they go I don't drink 10 years and
[40:10] you're like oh my God and I've had so
[40:12] many insightful conversations with
[40:14] people like yourself where you've heard
[40:16] their story their reason for giving up
[40:19] and there is a wonderful community of
[40:21] people and I love it I love being a part
[40:23] of that Community I'm really proud to be
[40:25] a part of it I hope that you know I can
[40:27] meet other people and chat to them about
[40:28] it because it's really nice it's lovely
[40:30] to be like let's go get a lime soda
[40:32] together you know yeah let's get a juice
[40:34] let's get a smoothie yeah yeah no it is
[40:37] true it's true and it's really
[40:38] interesting because they I can't
[40:39] remember I'm trying to remember there
[40:41] was this blog that came out years ago I
[40:44] can't even remember it now and there was
[40:46] this girl on Instagram who was getting a
[40:49] lot of likes and a lot of comments and a
[40:50] lot of
[40:51] attention and one day she just
[40:55] disappeared like she stopped posting
[40:58] and everyone was just like all the
[40:58] comments were like where are you what
[41:00] happened are you okay like what happened
[41:01] to you you know everyone was frantic
[41:03] trying to figure out what happened to
[41:04] her because they loved her they were
[41:06] following her and all the rest of it
[41:08] and what they didn't know is that it was
[41:11] built by a team that was trying to show
[41:13] that what people didn't notice is that
[41:15] in every picture she posted she was
[41:16] drinking and it was a made up it was
[41:18] almost like original AI that was made up
[41:21] to prove the point that you can love
[41:22] someone and you can think you're really
[41:23] close to them and you you can think
[41:25] their lifestyle looks amazing but
[41:26] actually they've got a drink in every
[41:27] picture they post and you didn't realize
[41:29] they had an alcohol problem so there was
[41:30] no real person who died but the point
[41:32] was that this your friends could be
[41:34] struggling even when they're posting
[41:37] these beautiful lifestyle pictures but
[41:39] are you aware and are you conscious of
[41:41] how much it affects you and I can't
[41:42] can't remember who built that page well
[41:45] I think that's one of the problems with
[41:46] alcohol is that if you came out with
[41:48] alcohol right now if alcohol wasn't a
[41:50] thing and you I've invented this drink
[41:53] that is going to make you like either
[41:54] really happy or really aggressive or
[41:56] really stupid and we're going to just
[41:58] sell it to the masses people be like now
[42:01] mate keep your funky juice like we don't
[42:03] want that that sounds terrible and it's
[42:05] one of those things because it is so
[42:06] socially acceptable the the addiction
[42:08] side of it the bad sides of it really do
[42:10] fly under the radar yeah and that's
[42:12] really interesting I'll tell you
[42:13] something I do love about being a
[42:14] non-drinker I love being the designated
[42:17] driver I love being that person that
[42:20] makes sure that everyone gets home I
[42:22] don't know I just I like being a
[42:24] Dependable person I I think I'm quite
[42:26] dependable and I really like that that
[42:28] um thing and I saw this crazy YouTube
[42:30] video once this was years ago of a guy
[42:34] that went to a bar he got drunk and he
[42:36] drove home and he crashed his car and I
[42:40] don't know if this is real it could have
[42:41] been fake but it's really impactful
[42:43] basically what his friend had done was
[42:46] set up the room as if he had been in a
[42:49] coma for like 10 years and his friend
[42:51] wakes up hours after the crash and his
[42:54] friend is there and he had all like old
[42:56] make up on to make him look older and
[42:59] now I'm thinking about it there's no way
[43:01] this could have been real because how
[43:02] would they have been able to pull that
[43:03] off but he basically is saying to him
[43:05] like you've been asleep for 10 years
[43:07] everyone's missed you like we can't
[43:09] believe you're awake this is amazing and
[43:11] it shows like how a stupid decision like
[43:13] driving drunk can affect the future of
[43:15] your life so I do love being the
[43:17] designated driver that is something I
[43:19] enjoy seeing my friends have a good time
[43:20] and being like don't worry Tom will take
[43:21] you home yeah I I I used to love been
[43:24] the designated driver until I realized
[43:26] that next go girlfriend just had me do
[43:28] that because I was the one who didn't do
[43:30] that wasn't a fun designated driver job
[43:32] but I've always been that guy since
[43:34] because so I I lived as a monk for three
[43:36] years yeah amazing and uh when I came
[43:38] back after that obviously I never went
[43:40] back to drinking alcohol and everything
[43:41] and so but I went back into the
[43:43] workplace and I remember everyone would
[43:45] always open up to me and give me advice
[43:46] but it's what you're saying when someone
[43:47] was drunk they' tell me their whole life
[43:49] story yeah next day they'd wake up and
[43:51] go Jay you'd actually remember what I
[43:52] said I'm I remember everything they're
[43:54] like please don't tell anyone like you
[43:55] know I love I love that part where I was
[43:57] like I was able to be there for people
[43:59] totally just hear their stories 100 and
[44:01] someone that had context the next day
[44:03] cuz if they told someone else who was
[44:04] drunk you'd both not remember and then
[44:06] it'd be gone no I I think the benefits
[44:07] that You' just pointed out of good sleep
[44:09] good health great mental Clarity they're
[44:12] huge but there's a couple of things I
[44:14] want to point out for everyone who's
[44:15] listening just as takeaways because Tom
[44:17] makes it so seamless when you're talking
[44:19] about it's really beautiful as well but
[44:21] one of the things you mentioned was
[44:23] Finding Alternatives and during my monk
[44:25] life we always talked about how there
[44:26] was there something that we called the
[44:28] higher taste and it was saying you can
[44:29] never give up a lower taste unless you
[44:31] had a higher taste and so there has to
[44:33] be a switch there has to be a repl to be
[44:34] a replac the fact that you found
[44:36] alternatives I think that's half the
[44:38] battle because most of us are trying to
[44:39] take something out of our lives and then
[44:41] you're just trying to fill it yeah and
[44:43] then you have to go back to what you had
[44:44] before because you're not finding a
[44:46] replacement so that was beautiful and
[44:47] the second thing you said which I loved
[44:49] which was having this conversation and
[44:51] dialogue with other people someone who's
[44:53] one year ahead of you someone who's 10
[44:55] years ahead someone who's 20 years ahead
[44:56] who's gone through that process and
[44:58] they're open and honest and vulnerable
[45:00] about you know what I did have a weak
[45:01] moment or you know what this was really
[45:03] tough for me and I think having those
[45:05] communities where you can talk about
[45:06] these things makes a massive difference
[45:08] so if anyone's struggling I hope that
[45:10] those two things can kind of you know
[45:12] give you the support you need and again
[45:13] it goes back to the message of of the
[45:15] show is that like you should ask for
[45:17] help and you should feel empowered to do
[45:19] so yeah but tell me about your monk life
[45:21] like that must have been amazing it was
[45:23] I've always been so tempted to go away
[45:25] and do one of those retreats where you
[45:27] know you go to somewhere like India and
[45:29] you go to those places where you don't
[45:30] speak for a month or something like that
[45:32] like that must have just been the most
[45:34] enlightening experience mate now that
[45:36] you've said that when when you want to
[45:37] go I'm going to take you please
[45:40] absolutely love to go I met a guy I was
[45:42] on holiday earlier this year and he had
[45:44] just got back from a retreat he did two
[45:46] weeks where he didn't make a sound MH
[45:49] and was just explaining to me how eye
[45:51] opening it was yeah yeah no I I mean to
[45:54] me it was one of the best experiences in
[45:56] my life because even the stuff that I
[45:59] did then I was 22 years old when I did
[46:00] it even the stuff that I did then I
[46:03] don't even know if I'd be able to do it
[46:04] anymore now but there was such a like
[46:06] energy you had as a 22y old where just
[46:08] open to any experience and wanting to
[46:10] try it all out aming and I think for me
[46:12] it was because and it comes back to the
[46:14] people that have done things when I was
[46:16] 18 was when I first met a monk I I never
[46:18] really knew what monks did or or any of
[46:21] their practices but I met a monk who I
[46:24] write about in my book who just
[46:27] blew my mind because he was the first
[46:28] person I met that I felt was at ease
[46:31] with himself and when I was 18 I'd met
[46:34] people who were like rich and famous and
[46:36] you know beautiful and powerful and all
[46:39] this type of stuff but I don't think I'd
[46:40] met anyone who was truly happy and
[46:42] content with themselves not happy like
[46:45] oh I'm so happy life's amazing I mean
[46:47] more like happy with who they who they
[46:49] were totally and for some reason at 18
[46:52] that kind of like was an arrow straight
[46:54] to my heart where I was like that's
[46:56] that's real I want that and it just it's
[46:59] so hard to explain because everyone's
[47:00] like well how did you know that at 18 I
[47:02] was like I don't know it must have been
[47:03] how powerful he was it's kind of like
[47:05] it's kind of like you wake up when when
[47:07] the sun's out and the lights out and you
[47:08] just wake up because you feel that
[47:10] energy and I felt it through him and
[47:13] then I I went to University and I'd talk
[47:15] to him and I'd meet him in the Summers
[47:16] and Christmases but I just decided I was
[47:19] like I want to do this because I'd met
[47:21] someone who I felt had emotional and
[47:23] mental Mastery in a way that I'd never
[47:26] seen before wow and so when I went out
[47:28] there and whether it was the meditation
[47:30] training or whether it was the
[47:32] Simplicity training of the lifestyle or
[47:34] whether it was the the the teachings and
[47:37] the values that you had to live by I
[47:40] just got so I got so much from it that I
[47:42] honestly believe that anything that I'm
[47:44] good at doing today is because of what I
[47:45] learned during that time and so anything
[47:47] I'm good at today is because of that do
[47:49] you think that you found what he had
[47:51] yeah I believe so and I would say that
[47:53] well has
[47:55] he's yeah and I still see him every
[47:57] yearing and he still has it yeah it's
[48:00] like Swag like it doesn't go away he
[48:02] still has it and yeah definitely
[48:04] definitely I got a glimpse into it
[48:05] obviously he's been doing it for you
[48:07] know nearly 30 years and I only did it
[48:09] for three but you still get to a glimpse
[48:13] of it and you get an experience of it so
[48:14] you know that it exists and I think
[48:16] that's half the battle too like even
[48:17] with your sobriety it's like you just
[48:19] need to know it exists totally and then
[48:21] you're like wow there's this other side
[48:23] 100% And even though it's a challenge
[48:24] and even though I'm still trying to be
[48:26] more mindful every day and I'm still
[48:27] working on myself because it's of course
[48:30] it's an endless ongoing thing yeah I
[48:33] know I know and I take a lot of friends
[48:35] and and people I know on Retreats there
[48:37] because just a couple of years ago I
[48:39] took uh someone that I love to one of
[48:41] the caves in rishikes so one of the
[48:43] things I love about caves is that
[48:44] they're equally dark and Silent yeah so
[48:48] it's almost like the first time like we
[48:50] could be silent in this room and it
[48:51] would be silent but the Silence of a
[48:52] cave is just different different level
[48:55] and so when you go in there you can't
[48:56] see anything either so you can't even
[48:58] see yourself so you're so deep into the
[49:00] cave that there's no light from the
[49:01] mouth of the cave anymore there's no
[49:03] light from the M mouth of the cave I
[49:04] don't know about that that really stress
[49:06] me
[49:07] out no you hold hands no you don't hold
[49:10] hands but it's it's just it's one of
[49:12] those experiences that you actually get
[49:14] to experience real Stillness and real
[49:17] silence and real real disconnection sure
[49:21] from everything around you and then you
[49:23] can actually listen to yourself yeah
[49:25] it's interesting I would love to do
[49:27] something like that something that I
[49:28] find myself doing a lot is if I see a
[49:34] beautiful landscape or something I will
[49:37] try
[49:38] and see if I can find an angle of it
[49:41] where there's nothing manmade in the
[49:44] view cuz you know what it's like like
[49:46] you see a beautiful Hill or something
[49:47] and there's a telephone pole in the
[49:49] middle of it or a lamp post or something
[49:51] so doing something like that where there
[49:53] is nothing but just mother nature and
[49:56] the vience and being with yourself I'm
[49:59] obsessed with nature it's like one of my
[50:00] biggest passions I'm absolutely like
[50:02] this new our planet show has just come
[50:04] out one sitting I've done the whole
[50:06] thing um so I would love to do something
[50:08] like that so next time you go in let me
[50:10] know with you we'll figure it out no
[50:12] where's where's a place I love nature
[50:13] too I just took my me and my wife just
[50:15] went to Barley oh I love barley yeah and
[50:17] it was unbelievable we went white water
[50:19] rafting and it almost felt like Jurassic
[50:22] Park I was just waiting for a dinosaur
[50:23] head to pop out and it was just
[50:25] beautiful it was so Lush it was natural
[50:28] waterfalls everywhere and another place
[50:30] that I've Loved naturewise India of
[50:32] course we mentioned but Iceland to go
[50:35] got to go to Iceland a few years ago and
[50:37] my friend was filming a a documentary
[50:39] out there and so I got to experience it
[50:41] with the documentary Travelers and we
[50:43] went to a real Glacier and we went toing
[50:45] you know and and it was incredible to
[50:47] just it was the first time I felt like
[50:49] I'd landed on another planet yeah yeah
[50:51] yeah it just I literally I was like this
[50:52] looks like nothing I've ever seen before
[50:55] in my life like I'm on another like I I
[50:57] could have I could have gone into outer
[50:58] space and landed on another there's a
[51:00] reason why every single space film
[51:02] Iceland is the first on the list for
[51:05] locations oh is that I know that I'm
[51:07] think Interstellar probably shot went to
[51:10] the GL they saw right so I'm sure all of
[51:12] those films you know because you could
[51:13] do you could do Mars you could do Venus
[51:16] all in you know in Iceland I would love
[51:18] to go I don't know we were thinking
[51:22] about doing some climbing and I'm not
[51:24] sure about how I feel about glaciers and
[51:28] walking across them and just falling and
[51:30] never being found yeah we we walked
[51:33] across them and obviously there were
[51:34] teams there but and then they had an
[51:36] expert and they went down into the
[51:38] glacier like they went into one like and
[51:40] it was and it was really scary because
[51:42] while we were walking on the glacier
[51:43] we've got the I forgot what those little
[51:44] boots are called the ones with the kind
[51:45] of like the little prongs yeah yeah I
[51:48] forgot what they're called but anyway we
[51:49] had those on and uh crons crampons
[51:52] crampons crampons okay crampons thank
[51:54] you for that Jack and so we're wearing
[51:55] these crampons and and literally it was
[51:57] like three steps further and you you
[51:59] would have fallen and you don't see it
[52:01] and you would never be found never you
[52:03] would never be found you would never
[52:04] know and it would be like that movie
[52:06] What's it 126 hours that guy had to sore
[52:08] off his own arm 126 hours mate in 10
[52:10] minutes the ice would just yeah know I
[52:13] that that's a bit too far for me well if
[52:15] you went with a group of you know
[52:16] experts and all the rest of it I think
[52:18] yeah but you've seen the documentary
[52:19] sometimes the experts go out and it's a
[52:21] one it's a oneway story they don't ever
[52:23] come back you know yeah yeah yeah no you
[52:25] got you got to be careful I agree I
[52:27] agree I'll show you some videos later
[52:28] though because it was pretty it was
[52:30] pretty spectacular it was really amazing
[52:32] no I I love I love that with your
[52:33] journey with Sab and and again the other
[52:36] thing we were talking about this earlier
[52:37] going back to it was you decided to take
[52:41] a break from acting yeah because you
[52:45] were doing this role it was really tough
[52:47] and challenging and and you like you
[52:48] need some time and again you were saying
[52:50] that that was misconstrued and I just
[52:52] before we dive into why you needed to
[52:54] take a break and and what was
[52:55] challenging about it I just wanted to
[52:58] just if you wanted to give context to
[52:59] that and you don't have to but if you
[53:00] wanted to to clarify what you meant and
[53:03] what was going on there it's only a
[53:05] break from acting because I'm an actor
[53:07] yeah it's not like the acting itself I
[53:10] just have been so lucky that in my life
[53:12] I've been working so much I just wanted
[53:14] to take a break I just wanted to be in
[53:17] one place for a while I wanted to be
[53:18] with my friends be with my family move
[53:20] into my house so it wasn't
[53:23] necessarily oh my God I need to have a
[53:25] break from acting cuz it's too much I
[53:27] just needed to have a break from
[53:29] traveling and and working and and also
[53:32] I've done so much of my growing up on
[53:34] the road I needed to do a lot of growing
[53:36] up at home paying my water bill paying
[53:39] my council tax and sorting out my bins
[53:41] and all that sort of stuff that they
[53:43] don't teach you at school which I think
[53:44] there should be a lesson I think there
[53:45] should be a lesson at school that's
[53:47] called life which is like laundry basic
[53:50] cooking like I didn't realize you have
[53:52] to pay for your water I just thought
[53:54] that was a luxury of living in England
[53:56] the water comes out the sky and then it
[53:57] comes out your TAP I was so behind on my
[53:59] Waterville I didn't realize I'm up to
[54:02] date now don't worry so yeah I just
[54:04] wanted to take this break and it's a
[54:05] shame again talking about the press and
[54:07] how they can spin things it's a shame
[54:09] that this year off has come after this
[54:11] incredibly hard job and that they kind
[54:13] of ran with this idea that yes the show
[54:16] did break me and yes it was difficult
[54:18] but I could have gone back to work I was
[54:19] always planning on taking this break
[54:21] after this job so thank you for giving
[54:23] me the time to sort of clarify that I am
[54:26] loving having time off and going back to
[54:28] work is something that isn't really on
[54:30] my radar yet I'm just loving being with
[54:32] my family and my friends and and
[54:34] enjoying you know the fruits of my labor
[54:36] a little bit and traveling and seeing
[54:38] the world cuz you know we get to see the
[54:40] world for work but it's different yeah
[54:44] you know going off of your own accord
[54:45] and and and seeing these places and
[54:47] meeting people is is what I love I'm
[54:49] very social which is one of the things I
[54:51] found so difficult about giving up
[54:52] alcohol is because I was like that's my
[54:54] key to my social life and then I
[54:55] realized I was like no you're just
[54:57] actually naturally a really social
[54:59] person the alcohol is just an additive
[55:02] to that so get rid of it so yeah so my
[55:04] my my year off has been amazing I'm
[55:07] loving it I'm six months seven months
[55:09] into it now I have a job to go to but
[55:12] you know obviously we're going through
[55:13] this writer strike right now we're
[55:15] unsure as to where we are um I'm hoping
[55:17] that you know the writers can make a
[55:19] deal and will be looked after as they
[55:20] should be because it would be great to
[55:23] get back to work but I'm in no rush I'm
[55:24] really loving some time at home how old
[55:26] are you now 27 yeah and so if you've
[55:28] been working since you were nine or at
[55:30] least later on into your teens I think I
[55:32] think people forget that and I I coach
[55:34] personally a lot of musicians and who go
[55:36] on tour a lot sure and I just finished a
[55:39] 40 City World Tour for my second book
[55:41] and we did like 40 cities maybe in like
[55:43] 75 80 days maybe like it was intense and
[55:46] we went all over the world we did like
[55:48] never done anything like that did 15
[55:50] cities in the US and then 25 cities
[55:54] around the world and so we did everyone
[55:55] from Paris Amsterdam Berlin Melbourne we
[55:58] did three shows at the Sydney Opera
[56:00] House Brisbane did Singapore did five
[56:02] shows in India did Dubai it was it and
[56:05] it was amazing I had one of the best
[56:06] experiences of my life at the same time
[56:09] I was reflecting on my music clients who
[56:12] have to do 100 150 shows a lot of them
[56:15] pull out of doing their tours a lot of
[56:17] them announce kind of like you're saying
[56:18] I took a break sure a lot of them will
[56:20] announce and say you know what guys I
[56:21] can't I can't finish I can't do it
[56:23] anymore and it's really interesting
[56:25] because I message some of them straight
[56:26] away saying I always could understand
[56:29] why you needed that now I actually have
[56:32] actual empathy for you because now I'm
[56:34] on the road and I can see how displacing
[56:37] it is sure and I'm older and I have a
[56:40] certain set of skills that help me with
[56:42] that based on my monk life and all the
[56:44] rest of it but I I can imagine if you've
[56:46] been touring since you were 15 years old
[56:48] which is what a lot of these artists
[56:49] have done yeah you've like you just said
[56:52] you grow up on the road sure and then
[56:54] all of a sudden you're like well who am
[56:55] I and who are my friends and and what is
[56:57] my life and now everyone that I pay is
[56:59] my friend and that's the only friends I
[57:01] have and you know and so it's really
[57:03] interesting how when you get a little
[57:04] glimpse into someone's life and then on
[57:06] my the last show I had was in
[57:08] Barcelona yeah it was amazing and the
[57:10] night before my last show Live Nation
[57:13] who was doing my show there they also do
[57:16] a Coldplay tour and they were like do
[57:17] you want to come to watch Cay I was like
[57:18] I'd love to watch Cay so when the night
[57:20] before to watch callay it was
[57:21] unbelievable they did four soldout shows
[57:23] of 655,000 people each night in
[57:25] Barcelona
[57:26] and Chris I went to watchs the fourth
[57:28] night and Chris Martin and the crew were
[57:29] just unbelievable yeah and then I found
[57:32] out as the 89th show and I was thinking
[57:35] gosh like it is so hard like it's just
[57:38] so hard and all their families are with
[57:39] them and traveling with them and all the
[57:41] rest of it and so I want to touch on
[57:43] that with you as well that walk us
[57:45] through because I've talked about this
[57:48] with actors offline and I don't think
[57:50] I've fully done it online and so if
[57:52] you're willing to go there I'd really
[57:53] appreciate it when you're playing a role
[57:55] I think as a viewer we massively
[57:58] underestimate how hard acting is
[58:01] especially when the role is the kind of
[58:03] role that you're playing in the crowded
[58:05] room yeah I I think we just
[58:07] underestimate as a view and I'm
[58:08] fortunate enough to know enough actors
[58:10] offline where I've had these
[58:10] conversations before whether whether
[58:12] it's people who do method acting or
[58:14] whether it's people who you know really
[58:16] try and get into character like you
[58:17] always hear about the stories of like
[58:18] how Jared Leto when he was becoming the
[58:20] Joker was sending people rats and human
[58:22] feces in their mail like literally tell
[58:25] if you me human feasts in my mail
[58:27] there'd be trouble I wouldn't be putting
[58:29] up with that you you and Jer in a boxing
[58:31] match yeah there'll be a boxing movie
[58:33] then yeah but but you know the idea of
[58:35] like I think I think as viewers we don't
[58:38] re it's what I'm saying is like when I
[58:39] went on tour I was like I get it I get
[58:41] it now as viewers we don't get it
[58:43] because we don't really hear about the
[58:45] Deep process that actors go through of
[58:48] getting into a role playing someone with
[58:51] multiple personalities like you know
[58:53] that I don't know is that is that tough
[58:55] or is is it or is that not am I getting
[58:57] it wrong and that's not actually the
[58:58] tough part you're definitely not getting
[59:00] it wrong I think it's just different
[59:01] it's Case by case you know there are
[59:03] people like Jared who who dive into
[59:04] their roles and they do things like
[59:06] sending people dead rats and stuff like
[59:08] that and they think that that's what
[59:09] they need to do I've always been really
[59:11] good at separating my onset emotions
[59:14] from my personal life emotions as a
[59:17] young kid I used to really heavily rely
[59:21] on my personal emotions to get them to
[59:23] come across on screen and I just found
[59:25] it really unhealthy I just found that
[59:27] like the line between my life and my
[59:29] character's life would be blurred and
[59:32] ultimately at the end of the experience
[59:34] of making the film I would be a very
[59:35] different person but not because of my
[59:37] experiences as Tom it would be because
[59:40] of my experiences as my character so I
[59:42] decided very early on to find certain
[59:46] techniques and certain ways to get into
[59:48] those emotions from a sort of technical
[59:50] point of view I never sit on set and
[59:52] think about my my mom getting sick or my
[59:55] or never speaking to my brothers again
[59:57] or something like that I never blur the
[59:59] lines with my personal life and my work
[01:00:01] life I always leave work at work there
[01:00:04] are jobs like the crowded room that are
[01:00:07] particularly taxing getting to those
[01:00:09] emotions on a daily basis is really
[01:00:11] difficult and really
[01:00:12] tiring but you know it's probably
[01:00:15] somewhat like Coldplay on that 89th show
[01:00:17] you just dig your heels in you realize
[01:00:19] you've got a job to do we're all
[01:00:20] wonderfully well paid there are people
[01:00:22] that work far harder for far less I
[01:00:24] recognize how lucky I am am so I'm like
[01:00:26] if I need to cry today and tomorrow and
[01:00:28] the next 50 days in a row I'll do so yes
[01:00:31] it's difficult but I think your question
[01:00:34] I'm probably the worst person to ask
[01:00:36] that because I think I have like a
[01:00:37] really healthy outlook on how I achieve
[01:00:41] my emotions on set yeah um but I have
[01:00:43] worked with people that shut their
[01:00:46] bedroom door and just dive into the
[01:00:48] character and are pouring through the
[01:00:49] script every night and and are in
[01:00:51] character all the time and I admire them
[01:00:54] I don't necessarily think it's the
[01:00:55] health EST way to go about it but yeah
[01:00:58] I've always been really strict on myself
[01:00:59] to leave my work at work obviously I
[01:01:01] come home and read the script and do all
[01:01:03] of my prep work but I'm not I'm leaving
[01:01:05] the character at work because it's too
[01:01:07] it's too much especially when you're
[01:01:08] playing a character like like Danny from
[01:01:10] the crowded room like you can't bring
[01:01:12] that into your personal life it's tough
[01:01:14] yeah yeah I mean that but I'm actually
[01:01:17] glad I asked it to you either way
[01:01:18] because what I'm actually hearing is you
[01:01:21] did it early on and you saw it wasn't
[01:01:23] healthy sure and so you actually found
[01:01:25] another way way yeah and and it's really
[01:01:27] interesting because a lot of people may
[01:01:29] not have found another way or that is
[01:01:31] their way and that is their method and
[01:01:33] so it actually is interesting hearing it
[01:01:35] from your perspective because you're
[01:01:37] actually saying yeah I could have gone
[01:01:38] down that road I could see the dangers
[01:01:41] with it right and and obviously depends
[01:01:43] on the roles too sorry you going to say
[01:01:44] no it's just it's my acting coach Ben
[01:01:46] Perkins was my acting coach on my first
[01:01:48] film and that film's really really
[01:01:50] emotionally intense and we started off
[01:01:53] by doing things like can you imagine you
[01:01:56] know your M passing or can you imagine
[01:01:58] things like that and I would cry
[01:01:59] instantly yeah and he was the one that
[01:02:02] actually recognized at a point this is
[01:02:04] too much for this young kid to kind of
[01:02:06] take so he devised these exercises where
[01:02:09] him and I could kind of have these fake
[01:02:12] arguments where I was as a 12-year-old
[01:02:14] oh maybe I was older than that
[01:02:15] 13-year-old could recognize that they
[01:02:17] were exercises and I would allow the
[01:02:19] emotion to kind of come from these kind
[01:02:21] of acting techniques let's call it so it
[01:02:25] was actually Ben that was the one that
[01:02:27] switched my my mindset I can't take
[01:02:30] credit for that yeah so you you live in
[01:02:32] LA yeah so I moved to LA five years ago
[01:02:37] and I moved to the state seven years ago
[01:02:38] so I was in New York for the first two
[01:02:40] where about in New York were you I was
[01:02:42] on 23rd Street near flat iron okay nice
[01:02:45] so yeah it was good in in Manhattan and
[01:02:47] uh moved with my wife we've been married
[01:02:49] for seven years together for 10
[01:02:51] fantastic and uh yeah it was it's just
[01:02:53] been really interesting mate it's like
[01:02:55] did you ever end up moving did you ever
[01:02:56] live in LA at all or in the US at all or
[01:02:58] have you always been in London sort of
[01:03:00] what we were talking about earlier I've
[01:03:01] kind of lived all over the place I've
[01:03:03] lived in La I've lived in New York I've
[01:03:05] lived in Atlanta you know I've lived in
[01:03:06] Cleveland which was amazing um so I I
[01:03:10] really like spending time in the states
[01:03:12] yeah we just obviously crowded room we
[01:03:13] did a year in New York yeah we moved to
[01:03:16] dve Becca we started off in Midtown and
[01:03:18] Midtown for me was a bit of a nightmare
[01:03:20] it's where all the schools are so I'd
[01:03:21] come home from work and I'd come outside
[01:03:23] and it's like all the biggest Spider-Man
[01:03:25] fans you
[01:03:26] oh my God yeah it's like the worst plan
[01:03:28] all the kids we moved out to Tribeca to
[01:03:31] this amazing apartment which was really
[01:03:33] lovely we're very lucky to be down there
[01:03:35] but um but where so how do you find La I
[01:03:39] so you know what it's really interesting
[01:03:40] because when I I moved to New York first
[01:03:42] yeah and I loved it I found New York to
[01:03:44] be just a bigger crazier London a bit
[01:03:47] more intense and and I love London I'm
[01:03:49] I'm a London boy through and through I
[01:03:50] went to University here my my family's
[01:03:53] still here my wife's family is here
[01:03:55] everyone's
[01:03:56] and so but but I enjoyed New York my
[01:03:58] wife didn't love New York and also at
[01:04:01] the same time I I started spending more
[01:04:03] time in LA for work and my wife and I
[01:04:06] just like fell more in love with each
[01:04:08] other when we were there and so that's
[01:04:09] what it was that Drew us there it wasn't
[01:04:11] really everyone's always like oh was it
[01:04:13] career I was like to be honest we went
[01:04:15] there for a month for work and we rented
[01:04:18] an apartment because we're going to be
[01:04:19] there for a month and we're living
[01:04:20] together there and we just loved living
[01:04:23] with each other there home is where the
[01:04:24] heart is
[01:04:26] we were like all right we love it here
[01:04:27] why don't we pack our bags and move
[01:04:28] across and so we went back to New York
[01:04:30] two months later we moved over to La so
[01:04:32] it wasn't even you know and now we've
[01:04:34] been there for 5 years and the truth is
[01:04:36] that I I was really intentional when I
[01:04:39] moved somewhere so while I'm building my
[01:04:41] purpose and my work and my career which
[01:04:43] I absolutely love what I get to do every
[01:04:44] day and I I I could never have dreamed
[01:04:47] of doing what I do to them super
[01:04:48] grateful but at the same time I was
[01:04:51] really intentional about building
[01:04:52] community and family and it was like an
[01:04:54] actual like process where I was like as
[01:04:57] well as you're always building the
[01:04:58] people you know at work you're always
[01:04:59] building relationships you're hiring
[01:05:01] employees and team members and
[01:05:02] everything at the same time I've got to
[01:05:04] think about actually making friendships
[01:05:06] because in London I got all my mates I
[01:05:08] got my best man at my wedding I've been
[01:05:09] mates with Raj for like 17 years like
[01:05:12] I've got people around me but in La I
[01:05:13] don't have that I don't have any family
[01:05:15] any friends I don't know anyone and so
[01:05:17] I've really made an effort and now after
[01:05:19] 5 years I can honestly say you know
[01:05:22] obviously not in a wonderful way but the
[01:05:23] pandemic did help deepen some of those
[01:05:25] friendships
[01:05:26] because iuck with people only could go
[01:05:28] deeper made some really good friends and
[01:05:30] so I feel happy there and I feel really
[01:05:34] connected to my purpose there and at the
[01:05:36] same time I love coming back to London
[01:05:38] right and hanging out with my mates and
[01:05:39] so and me and my wife made a decision
[01:05:41] when we moved that we would never say we
[01:05:44] lived anywhere we would just be allowed
[01:05:46] to go wherever we wanted to go so
[01:05:47] whenever my wife misses London she's
[01:05:50] back on a flight to London she'll come
[01:05:51] live here for two months and come back
[01:05:53] whenever she wants and and it's the same
[01:05:55] for me and that kind of like not having
[01:05:56] a rule around you know obviously we're
[01:05:58] lucky to have that choice that's an
[01:05:59] amazing luxury to have yeah of course
[01:06:01] yeah and but yeah I I I'm I share the
[01:06:04] same kind of outlook on it you know I
[01:06:06] couldn't really say I live anywhere I
[01:06:07] sort of live where the work is and when
[01:06:09] I'm not working I'm either here or in LA
[01:06:11] and uh and I'm so lucky to be able to
[01:06:13] sort of call the world my home I just go
[01:06:15] wherever the the wind takes me I guess
[01:06:18] yeah exactly but that's glorious yeah
[01:06:20] man yeah it's been good it's been good
[01:06:21] for me it's been good to me and and I
[01:06:23] think with because of the work I do very
[01:06:25] clearly lets people know whether I'd
[01:06:27] connect to them or not I feel like my
[01:06:29] work is so obviously one way that it's
[01:06:32] very easy cuz not everyone wants this in
[01:06:34] their life so it's kind of easy for
[01:06:35] people to be like no I'm not going to
[01:06:37] make any effort with Jay or I'm going to
[01:06:39] make lots of effort with Jay and so it
[01:06:40] kind of makes it very easy because my
[01:06:42] work is me do you find because of what
[01:06:44] you do and your skill set and your
[01:06:46] experiences and your life as a monk that
[01:06:49] people unload on you a lot yes like like
[01:06:52] you might meet a new person and they're
[01:06:54] sort of saying well I'm feeling this way
[01:06:55] and I I would love to try and get to a
[01:06:57] place of Enlightenment like that must
[01:06:59] happen to you a lot yes yeah a lot it
[01:07:01] can it can happen at the train station
[01:07:03] happen on a plane it can happen anywhere
[01:07:04] in the world yeah and do you welcome
[01:07:06] those conversations do you like having
[01:07:09] those sorts of conversations so I think
[01:07:11] it depends where we are and and it
[01:07:12] depends who it is and I always say to
[01:07:14] people as a disclaimer that I don't want
[01:07:16] to give you the belief that I can solve
[01:07:21] your life in 30 seconds or that I could
[01:07:24] ever solve your life for you totally
[01:07:26] just to be really clear that and I
[01:07:28] always say that to people because people
[01:07:29] are like Jay tell me what I need to do
[01:07:31] and I'll be like look I just wanted to
[01:07:32] be fully aware I'm happy to share some
[01:07:34] insights with you but I don't have the
[01:07:37] power or gift or magical ability to
[01:07:42] transform your life and nothing I can
[01:07:44] say in 30 seconds I don't even want to
[01:07:46] take that responsibility on because we
[01:07:49] should really think about this like you
[01:07:51] should reflect on your life like
[01:07:52] especially when people are making big
[01:07:53] decisions where it's like Jay should I
[01:07:54] break up should I move country should I
[01:07:56] do this and I'm like we're not solving
[01:07:58] this in 30 seconds please this is a
[01:08:00] bigger conversation yeah and and I like
[01:08:01] people that takes the pressure off me
[01:08:03] but it also takes the pressure off them
[01:08:04] yeah cuz a lot it's not even about me
[01:08:06] this is about the fact that that person
[01:08:07] needs to make a really important
[01:08:08] decision and they're putting all the
[01:08:10] pressure of their life on that moment
[01:08:12] and actually I'm saying well let's just
[01:08:13] take it off and here's a few things I
[01:08:15] want you to reflect and think about and
[01:08:17] I know that will help you and you'll
[01:08:18] figure it out and so yeah I I welcome
[01:08:20] them because I appreciate that I don't
[01:08:24] feel that the one holding space and I
[01:08:27] don't believe that I'm the one who has
[01:08:29] the power to hold space I believe that
[01:08:31] the Universe holds space I believe that
[01:08:33] energetically that space is held for
[01:08:35] others and I don't feel I'm this
[01:08:37] powerful human being who's who's the one
[01:08:40] that everything rests on and has the
[01:08:42] answer to everything and I think that's
[01:08:44] what allows me to be liberated from it
[01:08:46] where I'm not like I also don't put the
[01:08:48] pressure on myself going God I better
[01:08:49] say the most perfect thing to this I
[01:08:51] better change this person's life yeah
[01:08:53] and I can't and I don't and and I think
[01:08:55] once a time I probably did feel that way
[01:08:57] like when you're when you're immature
[01:08:59] and you're in amateur in your work you
[01:09:00] almost feel like you have to have all
[01:09:02] the answers and I'm like you know what I
[01:09:03] don't and it's fine and actually people
[01:09:05] really appreciate it when you just chat
[01:09:07] to them and you know and so yeah and and
[01:09:10] again you know I'm I'm always happy to
[01:09:12] listen to someone when I can obviously
[01:09:14] there's sometimes when I'm like rushing
[01:09:15] late for a plane or I'm trying to get
[01:09:17] into a car or whatever and I can't I
[01:09:19] can't do it but I always stop and say
[01:09:21] hello give someone a hug and all the
[01:09:23] yeah so I don't know if that answers
[01:09:24] your questions but absolutely it does
[01:09:26] yeah I guess what's what you're saying
[01:09:28] about making decisions something that I
[01:09:29] am constantly battling with myself is
[01:09:32] the inner battle between my gut and my
[01:09:34] brain I know that sounds really weird
[01:09:37] like real I go with my gut a lot I'm
[01:09:39] very very I think a lot of the decisions
[01:09:41] I make in life are very sort of
[01:09:43] instinctual I don't like to be bombarded
[01:09:45] with evidence and facts and all that
[01:09:47] sort of stuff I just like to feel a
[01:09:49] certain way about how I would like
[01:09:52] something to sort of transpire can be
[01:09:54] taking a fil accepting a script doing a
[01:09:56] business deal buying a house like it's
[01:09:58] all sorts of different things through
[01:10:00] your monk life did you feel like you
[01:10:04] would rely on your kind of inner
[01:10:06] instincts rather than like getting the
[01:10:09] evidence of this is going to make you
[01:10:10] this much money or if you do that these
[01:10:12] are the risks how do you where do you
[01:10:14] stand with that sort of thing that was
[01:10:16] the most poorly worded question you know
[01:10:18] what I mean no no no mate mate I think
[01:10:20] both I think this has been such a
[01:10:22] conversation that that is what a
[01:10:23] question sounds like in a conversation
[01:10:25] and think I've asked youir poorly
[01:10:28] questions today as well but I think
[01:10:29] that's what
[01:10:31] real rather mate I've got question one
[01:10:34] like right but no I I I think I get what
[01:10:36] you're saying and if I go on the wrong
[01:10:37] track let me know but living as a monk
[01:10:40] you're trained to understand that
[01:10:42] everything exists in a certain mode and
[01:10:45] so I'll explain what that means and so
[01:10:48] in the monk philosophy there are three
[01:10:49] modes and the modes are the mode of
[01:10:52] ignorance the mode of passion and the
[01:10:54] mode of goodness and said that every
[01:10:56] decision every thought every action
[01:10:59] every intention every relationship can
[01:11:02] be in the mode of ignorance mode of
[01:11:04] passion or mode of goodness and the mode
[01:11:06] of ignorance is where your relationships
[01:11:07] or any Act is based on insecurity or
[01:11:10] fear so when you're doing something out
[01:11:11] of fear or you're doing it out of
[01:11:13] insecurity or you're doing it out of
[01:11:14] pressure that's considered the mode of
[01:11:16] ignorance and energetically we all feel
[01:11:19] that right like you know whether you I
[01:11:21] would know whether you were being forced
[01:11:22] to do this interview today out of out
[01:11:25] some sort of fear or some sort of
[01:11:26] whatever it may be the mode of passion
[01:11:30] is where you're doing something because
[01:11:32] you want a certain result you're doing
[01:11:35] it just for the reward you're doing it
[01:11:37] just because it's going to get you what
[01:11:39] you want it's going to get you to the
[01:11:40] goal okay and so that's considered the
[01:11:42] mode of passion and again energetically
[01:11:44] you can tell that when someone has an
[01:11:45] agenda or someone wants something out of
[01:11:47] you I've come here to get my point
[01:11:48] across on something or right totally and
[01:11:50] then finally the mode of goodness is the
[01:11:53] energy of like I feel really at peace I
[01:11:56] feel really at ease this feels aligned
[01:11:59] with my values and therefore it feels
[01:12:01] like the right decision and so we were
[01:12:03] trained to sense energetically whether
[01:12:06] things felt like the mode of ignorance
[01:12:08] mode of passion or mode of goodness
[01:12:09] which was a really helpful framework
[01:12:11] because sometimes things were really
[01:12:13] hard to just sense without knowing where
[01:12:17] it sat in terms of a characteristic
[01:12:19] that's so interesting and so that was
[01:12:20] really really helpful at the time and so
[01:12:21] I find that I'm I'm the same as you
[01:12:24] where I make decisions
[01:12:25] energetically but I think having moved
[01:12:29] into the real world again I felt that I
[01:12:32] had to start getting used to
[01:12:34] understanding other elements kind of
[01:12:36] what you mentioned earlier which I loved
[01:12:37] which was like I wish they had a class
[01:12:39] on life at school because it's like you
[01:12:42] haven't paid your bill and you know you
[01:12:44] you know there's football players not
[01:12:45] paying their taxes or whatever it may be
[01:12:47] and like uh that may be for different
[01:12:48] reasons but anyway you get the point
[01:12:50] that that there's some things that you
[01:12:51] just don't know and so what I've started
[01:12:54] to do and I've said this a few times and
[01:12:56] that's why it's a little formula that I
[01:12:57] use when I sit down with someone whether
[01:12:59] it's business whether it's relationships
[01:13:01] whether it's work even whether it's this
[01:13:02] the first thing is always energy that's
[01:13:05] my first gate that I that I want to get
[01:13:07] through and if I don't feel
[01:13:08] energetically aligned with someone then
[01:13:11] already there's no future here like it's
[01:13:13] not going anywhere wow and then the next
[01:13:15] thing I look at is strategically if it's
[01:13:16] business so if it's personal it's only
[01:13:18] energy but if it's business I look at
[01:13:20] well I like this person energetically do
[01:13:23] I think they're strategically aligned
[01:13:25] with where this has to go like do I
[01:13:27] think they can actually implement this
[01:13:29] do I believe because a lot of people
[01:13:30] have great energy but they don't know
[01:13:32] how to implement anything and then
[01:13:34] finally I look at well does the money
[01:13:36] align does the monetary value align with
[01:13:39] the energy and strategy sure that's been
[01:13:41] my business version of what I love
[01:13:43] learned as a monk so what you're saying
[01:13:44] then that is a combination of both
[01:13:47] correct allowing like you're gut your
[01:13:49] energy to kind of allow yourself to
[01:13:52] pursue further the opportunity yeah and
[01:13:55] then you take a sort of mental look at
[01:13:57] it to be like I'm accepting the
[01:13:59] opportunity from a emotional point of
[01:14:01] view now I need to see if it makes sort
[01:14:03] of logical sense correct and if it
[01:14:05] doesn't then we're going to stop there
[01:14:06] again yeah exactly so I I found that
[01:14:08] more useful for me because I found that
[01:14:11] energetically I can get excited about a
[01:14:13] lot of stuff yeah the same and I'm and
[01:14:16] I'm that kind of person and again I
[01:14:17] never want to block that at the same
[01:14:19] time I think we have to become more
[01:14:21] selective with our opportunities and
[01:14:22] know when to say no and know how to
[01:14:24] manage and that's at least help me sure
[01:14:26] so again I'm not saying anyone has to
[01:14:28] live like that I'm just that's that's
[01:14:29] it's interesting it's really interesting
[01:14:31] I I am very much like go off my G I tell
[01:14:33] you what my mom is an unbelievable judge
[01:14:37] of character wow and I think she might
[01:14:39] have without knowing what you're talking
[01:14:41] about where she can pick up on people's
[01:14:44] energies yeah because we can meet a new
[01:14:46] person as a family we've met this new
[01:14:49] person three of us could love this new
[01:14:51] person and another three could not like
[01:14:52] this new person and my mom will be like
[01:14:55] no no don't like that person and then
[01:14:58] within six months all of us are like do
[01:14:59] you remember that person that we were
[01:15:00] really good friends with for a little
[01:15:01] bit she's really got a Keen Eye for
[01:15:04] people that we would get along with yeah
[01:15:06] she's amazing like that moms are like
[01:15:08] that now that you say that all my mates
[01:15:10] who let me down when I was a teenager
[01:15:13] your every time and I was like Mom no
[01:15:15] they're my best friend I'm never going
[01:15:17] to leave them they're like a brother to
[01:15:18] me and then like s months later the
[01:15:20] person stab you in the back and then
[01:15:22] you're like oh mom like you know but the
[01:15:24] good thing about is they wouldn't judge
[01:15:25] you for it you know they're like look I
[01:15:27] told you but you have to make your own
[01:15:29] mistakes yeah exactly exactly but I it's
[01:15:32] interesting that you've been able to
[01:15:33] hold on to that and I love that do you
[01:15:35] feel like you were asking me about
[01:15:36] moving to LA and I I think what have you
[01:15:39] felt and there's a part of you that's
[01:15:40] obviously wanting to be back in Kingston
[01:15:42] be back to who you are have you felt
[01:15:44] that there's been parts of yourself that
[01:15:46] have been challenged I don't feel
[01:15:47] sitting with you today that you know I I
[01:15:50] don't know you before I don't know you
[01:15:51] after I've only met you today so I I
[01:15:53] can't judge who you are or
[01:15:55] what you enjoy I all I can say is that
[01:15:57] when I'm sitting with you today I feel
[01:15:59] like I'm sitting with an authentic
[01:16:00] individual and your energy comes across
[01:16:01] very easily thank you do you feel like
[01:16:03] you've had to hold on to that at times
[01:16:06] with opportunities challenges the
[01:16:08] industry or or is that all stuff that we
[01:16:11] kind of make up in our heads and it's
[01:16:12] actually just be yourself and you're
[01:16:13] fine I really don't know the answer to
[01:16:15] that question I I I've definitely walked
[01:16:18] away from a lot and I think had I not
[01:16:20] walked away from certain situations
[01:16:22] let's just put it at that I would be a
[01:16:24] very different person today I've been
[01:16:27] really good at keeping in touch with my
[01:16:28] friends keeping my family close
[01:16:31] listening to the
[01:16:32] lessons not getting caught up in the
[01:16:34] Hollywood hype like I really am a
[01:16:37] massive fan of making movies but I
[01:16:39] really do not like Hollywood it is not
[01:16:41] for me that the business really scares
[01:16:43] me I understand that I'm a part of that
[01:16:46] business and I enjoy my kind of
[01:16:47] interactions with it but that said I am
[01:16:51] always looking for ways to kind of
[01:16:52] remove myself from it to kind of just
[01:16:55] live as normal a life as possible today
[01:16:58] doing this is a very rare thing for me
[01:17:00] to do like in London to come in and
[01:17:03] speak to someone about my life is
[01:17:05] something I would not typically do but
[01:17:07] because I'm a fan of yours and I was
[01:17:09] Keen to kind of hear what you had to say
[01:17:12] and and chat to you today I felt like
[01:17:14] this would be a safe space for me to do
[01:17:16] that um but yeah I definitely think it
[01:17:19] has been an ongoing thought which is
[01:17:23] Don't Lose Yourself I've seen so many
[01:17:25] people come before me and lose
[01:17:27] themselves and I've had friends that
[01:17:29] I've grown up with that aren't friends
[01:17:30] of mine anymore because they've lost
[01:17:32] themselves to this business and I just
[01:17:35] am really really Keen to focus on what
[01:17:37] makes me happy which is my family it's
[01:17:39] my friends it's my carpentry my golf um
[01:17:43] the charity that my mom runs like that
[01:17:45] is the stuff that makes me really happy
[01:17:47] and that's the stuff that I should
[01:17:48] protect my relationship is the thing
[01:17:50] that I keep most sacred I don't talk
[01:17:52] about it I I try my my best to keep it
[01:17:55] as private as possible we both feel very
[01:17:57] strongly that that is the healthiest way
[01:17:59] for us to to move on as a couple um so I
[01:18:03] do try to keep as removed from it as
[01:18:05] possible like you'll never see me at an
[01:18:07] award show that I don't have to be at
[01:18:09] I'm never going to a red carpet event
[01:18:11] that I'm not in the film of you know I
[01:18:13] don't want the attention when I don't
[01:18:15] need it I love the spotlight I love the
[01:18:18] pressure that comes with it just watch
[01:18:20] that tennis documentary breaking point I
[01:18:22] haven't seen it yet I love you got see
[01:18:23] it it's amazing I never realized how
[01:18:25] brutal tennis was I've always been a
[01:18:26] huge tennis lover I am now absolutely in
[01:18:29] awe of what those athletes go through
[01:18:31] but there's a quote from Billy Jean King
[01:18:33] that's on the um stand at her Stadium in
[01:18:37] New York that says pressure is a
[01:18:39] privilege and that is so true like oh my
[01:18:42] God feeling pressure on a daily basis in
[01:18:45] the capacity that we feel is such a
[01:18:47] privilege I love feeling pressure I feel
[01:18:49] like I thrive Under Pressure the best
[01:18:51] golf I've ever played in my life is when
[01:18:53] there are cameras around and people are
[01:18:54] watching
[01:18:55] I just think that that is a real amazing
[01:18:57] thing to be able to experience so I
[01:18:59] enjoy it while I can and then when it
[01:19:01] becomes a bit much I kind of become a
[01:19:03] bit of a recluse and I disappear I come
[01:19:05] back to Kingston I play golf I play
[01:19:07] tennis I hang out with my friends and my
[01:19:09] family do the pub quiz and and all that
[01:19:11] sort of stuff yeah um so yeah so it is
[01:19:14] something I actively try to do as I get
[01:19:16] older it only gets easier yeah yeah
[01:19:19] absolutely yeah and and I I can I can
[01:19:21] relate to that where in in my in my
[01:19:24] small way or in my world where a lot of
[01:19:26] my friends think like I'm in La like
[01:19:27] always at events always at Pi I'm I'm
[01:19:29] not I'm like in bed by 9:30 p.m. and I
[01:19:32] only live there because it works for me
[01:19:33] in the world that I do and what I do and
[01:19:35] sure and and I enjoy living in LA but
[01:19:38] it's it I don't live there for Hollywood
[01:19:39] and I think that's often the perception
[01:19:41] as well I was like oh you're all
[01:19:42] Hollywood now and I'm like well no not
[01:19:44] really like I I don't re I don't really
[01:19:46] go to all the events and Gatherings and
[01:19:48] stuff unless I need to be there or I'm
[01:19:50] connected to a project so so I relate to
[01:19:53] that what you mentioned a few things
[01:19:54] there but if I had to ask you is Tom
[01:19:56] when do you feel most yourself like when
[01:19:58] do you feel most connected or and what
[01:20:01] are you trying to reconnect to if you're
[01:20:02] like well I know what it is but I'm
[01:20:04] still figuring it out again I think what
[01:20:06] I feel most myself is to do in my
[01:20:08] relationship so I'm going to leave that
[01:20:09] and not talk about that absolutely but I
[01:20:11] think the other thing and this is such a
[01:20:13] stupid thing but it's when I'm playing
[01:20:15] good golf like there's something about
[01:20:18] how go golf is the most humbling sport
[01:20:20] in the world it doesn't matter who you
[01:20:21] are doesn't matter how much money you've
[01:20:22] got how successful you are
[01:20:25] golf will batter you no matter who you
[01:20:27] are and I love that's what I love about
[01:20:29] it you know you it's such a leveling
[01:20:30] sport I love going to a golf course and
[01:20:33] meeting new people that I've never
[01:20:34] played with before playing around a golf
[01:20:37] I struggle when I don't play badly like
[01:20:39] I've got a bit of a temper and like
[01:20:41] you're supposed to have 14 clubs in your
[01:20:42] bag I currently have nine and you can
[01:20:44] probably guess why um but I I just love
[01:20:49] being outside I've always been an
[01:20:50] outdoorsy person I love being on the
[01:20:53] golf course I love my mates they all
[01:20:55] love playing golf there's just something
[01:20:56] about the challenge of shooting lower
[01:20:59] than your lowest score that really kind
[01:21:01] of takes my mind off of the work the
[01:21:04] interesting thing about golf is that you
[01:21:07] could be having a terrible day you could
[01:21:08] be really upset about something and if
[01:21:09] you play really well you completely
[01:21:11] forget about it if you play really badly
[01:21:14] you then are playing badly because of
[01:21:16] what's happening outside of golf it's
[01:21:18] like a really weird kind of Catch 22 I
[01:21:22] guess um but I love it I think when I'm
[01:21:25] playing good golf is when I feel most
[01:21:26] like myself yeah wow that's that's
[01:21:28] that's a unique answer but I get it
[01:21:31] saying yeah I've only ever played golf
[01:21:33] like twice in my life right and I
[01:21:35] totally get the point of how humbling it
[01:21:37] is is horrendous no matter how quickly
[01:21:40] you pick up other things in life golf is
[01:21:42] not one of those things that you pick up
[01:21:44] that easily you can sign the biggest
[01:21:47] deal of your life and go out to play
[01:21:48] golf to celebrate and it will ruin your
[01:21:50] day like absolutely ruin day don't go
[01:21:52] out to play golf to celebrate out to
[01:21:55] celebrate no crazy do you play do you
[01:21:58] still play any sport I love playing
[01:21:59] football when I'm back here so that's
[01:22:01] one of the things my mates know that
[01:22:02] when I'm back in London we're going to
[01:22:04] play a game where do you play well we
[01:22:06] just we we will just play on like a
[01:22:07] seven aside pitch or a five aside pitch
[01:22:09] like close to Northwest London which is
[01:22:11] where most my mates are so like store
[01:22:14] edgear Watford that's like where all my
[01:22:15] main mates are and so we'll just go rent
[01:22:17] a pitch kick a boil about I'm not any
[01:22:19] good anymore but I still got the full
[01:22:21] kit and the socks all that kind I always
[01:22:23] look dressed
[01:22:25] bro I've actually got Neymar's kit like
[01:22:27] from him wow so you best believe I show
[01:22:29] up to five as side in his full kit I
[01:22:32] love it I love it is it signed by him
[01:22:33] too no it's not signed by that's just
[01:22:35] yeah that's just his kid we went on a
[01:22:37] lad's holiday to Portugal recently to
[01:22:39] play golf and at the resort we were
[01:22:41] staying at the the people were so nice
[01:22:43] they said let's have an England versus
[01:22:45] Portugal football match there was like I
[01:22:47] think there was eight of us and there
[01:22:49] was a bunch of Brits that were working
[01:22:50] at the resort so they kind of joined our
[01:22:52] team and we literally did England versus
[01:22:53] Portugal is a full-size pitch we did 60
[01:22:57] Minutes 30 minutes each way I'm fit I
[01:23:00] train every day I absolutely love my
[01:23:01] fitness I really really like I'm into it
[01:23:04] by the end I could not make Five Paces
[01:23:07] without my legs cramping up they are so
[01:23:10] fit these football players it's
[01:23:12] unbelievable and we won and it's so
[01:23:14] funny how the first 10 minutes of the
[01:23:15] game was really friendly like soft fouls
[01:23:18] sorry mate like your free kick and by
[01:23:20] the end it was Savage it was really
[01:23:23] intense wow at least you won though we
[01:23:25] won I got an assist it was actually a
[01:23:27] glorious assist as well actually I just
[01:23:29] I pinged the ball over the top my
[01:23:31] brother made a run and it bounced and he
[01:23:34] managed to get his foot to it and he
[01:23:35] chipped the keeper and scored it was but
[01:23:37] there's no footage there there's no
[01:23:39] footage no proof yeah no proof yeah no
[01:23:41] proof I sometimes think when the whole
[01:23:43] no proof thing like we had the craziest
[01:23:45] experience of my life the other day I'll
[01:23:47] tell you about it because our lives are
[01:23:49] so crazy like there's no why would I lie
[01:23:52] but the other day we went swimming with
[01:23:54] killer whales in Mexico I said the other
[01:23:56] day it was last year and it was one of
[01:23:59] the most humbling experiences of my life
[01:24:01] there's no proof of it there's no
[01:24:03] evidence because it was so off the cuff
[01:24:04] we weren't planning on doing it so most
[01:24:06] people I tell are like you definitely
[01:24:07] didn't do that but we we were in we were
[01:24:10] in Mexico and we were on a boat and we
[01:24:13] just so happened to see this pot of
[01:24:15] Ora Jack my security guard thought it'
[01:24:18] be a good idea to jump in he jumped
[01:24:20] straight in flippers on goggles on and
[01:24:22] we were driving to keep up with the
[01:24:24] Wales cuz they were kind of following
[01:24:25] our boat so by the time Jack had jumped
[01:24:27] in he was like this he was like 100 m
[01:24:31] away and you could see him and the
[01:24:33] whales were like swimming around him so
[01:24:35] I'm starting to freak out cuz he's a
[01:24:37] good friend of mine and he's your
[01:24:38] security and he's my security I'm like
[01:24:40] Jack we got to get back to the hotel bro
[01:24:43] um so I said to the guy like excuse me
[01:24:44] sir can you turn around and go and get
[01:24:46] my friend CU we now can't see him
[01:24:48] anymore like he's gone we found him we
[01:24:50] got him back in the boat and he sort of
[01:24:52] said like Lads you have to get in there
[01:24:54] it's unlike anything you've ever seen
[01:24:56] before my brother Harry's like Googling
[01:24:58] whether or not it's safe to swim with
[01:24:59] them and it's sort of the general
[01:25:01] consensus online is don't go swimming
[01:25:03] with killer whales you can there's never
[01:25:05] been a recorded tack in the wild but
[01:25:08] they are wild animals big as a bus and
[01:25:11] also Jack's giving it like don't worry
[01:25:13] Tom I'll be there I'll look after you
[01:25:14] I'm like Jack what are you going to do
[01:25:16] bro like what's this this whale decides
[01:25:18] to eat me so anyway we put the flippers
[01:25:21] on put the goggles on we find the whales
[01:25:24] they're sort of interacting with the
[01:25:25] back of the boat they're clearly
[01:25:27] curious and I just thought like I guess
[01:25:31] it goes back to what you're saying the
[01:25:32] mode of ignorance I just was like I'm
[01:25:35] going to try it and see what happens I
[01:25:36] jumped in my brother jumped in Jack
[01:25:39] jumped in we kind of came together with
[01:25:42] 30 miles out of the coast so it's
[01:25:43] literally like dark blue water nothing
[01:25:46] below us and to my relief the whales had
[01:25:50] gone we couldn't see them so I'm sort of
[01:25:53] thinking oh well that that's actually a
[01:25:54] bit of a touch at least I can say I
[01:25:56] jumped in and they have gone but then
[01:25:59] Jack said look down and we looked down
[01:26:01] and it came from beneath us and what has
[01:26:04] been such an interesting experience for
[01:26:06] me was as soon as I saw the whale I
[01:26:09] wasn't scared anymore because I could
[01:26:11] just
[01:26:12] tell that it wasn't going to eat me you
[01:26:15] I don't know I don't know how to explain
[01:26:17] it but you could just see from its body
[01:26:18] language I remember it so vividly it
[01:26:20] swam up to us it was maybe 10 met below
[01:26:23] us and it was kind of motionlessly sort
[01:26:25] of just looking at us and then it kind
[01:26:27] of rolled on its back it did this weird
[01:26:29] thing where it kind of put its head like
[01:26:31] this and you could see it's eye like we
[01:26:33] were having this crazy like moment and
[01:26:36] then it just swam off and it was gone
[01:26:39] and then for 3 hours afterwards I
[01:26:41] couldn't speak I had the biggest
[01:26:42] adrenaline dump I just basically was
[01:26:46] asleep but it was such an amazing
[01:26:48] experience to sort of meet the apex
[01:26:51] predator of the world and it kind of
[01:26:53] look at you and just swim away most
[01:26:56] people don't believe me because I
[01:26:57] believe there's no evidence but it was I
[01:27:00] think about it now and then as you know
[01:27:02] what it's so funny as well I see these I
[01:27:04] like our planet there's there's more
[01:27:06] footage of orkers hunting and another
[01:27:08] way in which they hunt there is no way I
[01:27:10] would do that again there's no way I'd
[01:27:12] get in there again but yeah it
[01:27:14] Wasing hearing you explain it is like
[01:27:17] you're so present yeah like you can tell
[01:27:20] that you're just you were so present in
[01:27:21] that moment like you stopped thinking
[01:27:22] about like I we you know if I told this
[01:27:25] Afters no one's going to believe me or
[01:27:26] whatever it is you're just like wait a
[01:27:27] minute yeah you know nature makes you
[01:27:29] present like that and and that's what I
[01:27:31] love about nature is it's completely
[01:27:33] unbiased as well like if that whale
[01:27:34] wanted to have a snack then you know
[01:27:37] it's not looking at you going oh no but
[01:27:39] that's a famous person I got a leave him
[01:27:40] alone or it just you are at one with
[01:27:43] Mother Nature we are in the middle of
[01:27:44] the ocean there's nothing we could do
[01:27:47] and we just were able to enjoy somewhat
[01:27:49] maybe like being in the cave like you
[01:27:51] were saying it was just about us and
[01:27:53] this way
[01:27:54] my brother and I were holding hands but
[01:27:56] then as soon as it presented itself to
[01:27:58] us any stress just dissipated and it was
[01:28:02] just this unbelievable experience and it
[01:28:04] was so leveling it was so humbling that
[01:28:07] it makes me feel like I can take on
[01:28:08] certain things so it was honestly even
[01:28:11] thinking about the experience now my
[01:28:12] heart is racing yeah yeah I can imagine
[01:28:14] yeah it was it was wild yeah it was a
[01:28:16] cool experience unbelievable that's
[01:28:18] that's an incredible experience and it
[01:28:19] is different from the cave though
[01:28:21] because I do think it's it's different
[01:28:23] when you're with with another living
[01:28:24] being sure and so that's what I found
[01:28:27] like my my closest experience to what
[01:28:29] you're talking about is I went tracking
[01:28:32] with well looking for mountain gorilla
[01:28:34] in Rwanda last year oh that's top of my
[01:28:37] list I would love to do that okay yeah
[01:28:38] we we should do it I would do that again
[01:28:40] any day because it was unbelievable so
[01:28:43] you're not again these gorillas are not
[01:28:44] like in a park or something in they're
[01:28:47] Mountain Gilla they're in their world
[01:28:50] and you go and look for them and there's
[01:28:51] no tagging devices or any t there's
[01:28:54] people who have watched the gorilla for
[01:28:56] so many years that they know where their
[01:28:58] droppings are they know where families
[01:29:00] hang out they know what their routines
[01:29:01] are so depending on what time you're
[01:29:03] going out there's someone who's just
[01:29:04] around them who's calling their friend U
[01:29:06] calling your guide saying walk this
[01:29:09] exactly just just to make it very very
[01:29:10] clear that you know the mon the gorilla
[01:29:12] is being treated very well uh so you're
[01:29:14] literally looking around and you could
[01:29:16] be on the lookout for them for like two
[01:29:18] to 6 hours you may not find them you're
[01:29:21] just hiking I love that that you might
[01:29:23] not find yeah you might not find them so
[01:29:25] we found them in 2 hours one group that
[01:29:27] we heard about cuz you go in smaller
[01:29:29] groups of like 10 the other group that
[01:29:31] we were friends with they took eight
[01:29:32] hours to find gorillas but they saw them
[01:29:34] too and when I went I was kind of like
[01:29:36] oh we're going to see one gorilla
[01:29:37] whatever like they're going to be far
[01:29:39] away like I was a bit skeptical because
[01:29:40] I didn't know how it was going to be and
[01:29:42] it was incredible because we looked
[01:29:43] around for two hours and I'll show you
[01:29:45] the video afterwards but we got and we
[01:29:48] just saw them like hanging out kind of
[01:29:49] like how I'm looking at everyone here
[01:29:51] just hanging out still and then all of a
[01:29:53] sudden and they all started walking
[01:29:55] together and there was a family of 20
[01:29:57] gorillas and you got two silver backs
[01:29:59] that are like you know they're like
[01:30:00] their fists are like just huge yeah
[01:30:04] exactly and and it was really
[01:30:05] interesting because the guides who were
[01:30:07] there with us they said to us that when
[01:30:09] you go close to them kind of like and
[01:30:11] this is why I remembered it and why I'm
[01:30:12] telling you it's because when you were
[01:30:13] talking about the way the whale looked
[01:30:15] at you and it was kind of like you knew
[01:30:16] it wasn't going to eat you yeah yeah
[01:30:18] yeah and so they were saying that when
[01:30:19] you get close to these gorillas the only
[01:30:21] thing you can't do is you can't touch
[01:30:22] their kids and you can't touch them
[01:30:24] going to drop something near their kids
[01:30:25] and then try get it back because they'll
[01:30:27] think you're trying to harm their kids
[01:30:28] totally but what they recommended was
[01:30:30] they said you had to make this sound
[01:30:32] when you see them and this sound means
[01:30:35] we come in peace and so the sound
[01:30:38] was so that's you have to make that
[01:30:40] sound I was all right this is some
[01:30:42] Disneyland stuff whatever I like I'm not
[01:30:45] believing this stuff like whatever like
[01:30:47] I was all I'm going to play around with
[01:30:48] them and so I'm walking around so we go
[01:30:50] to the gorilla and we get close to them
[01:30:52] and I made that sound cuz we were told
[01:30:53] they were like make that sound and then
[01:30:55] the gorilla did it back and it was just
[01:30:58] unbelievable and then there was this one
[01:31:00] moment where we were walking and we were
[01:31:01] literally surrounded by Gorilla and now
[01:31:03] I was getting it and that's when I was
[01:31:04] like a bit scared because they were like
[01:31:06] all around us and like literally if they
[01:31:08] ran at you like I'm done you nothing you
[01:31:11] can do nothing nothing you can do and so
[01:31:12] we're walking they're walking around us
[01:31:14] and this massive silver bat came up so
[01:31:17] I'm my business manager was with me as
[01:31:19] well and so he's there he's like my
[01:31:21] godfather in La like he really takes
[01:31:24] care of me very close to him and so this
[01:31:27] big um this big gorilla that walks
[01:31:30] behind him and I'm looking at him going
[01:31:32] oh man like he stopped and we're all
[01:31:35] looking at him because he's got this
[01:31:36] massive silver back behind him and I'm
[01:31:39] and we're all like how do we tell them
[01:31:40] to move and the guy's like just be still
[01:31:41] like just you know be really present
[01:31:43] like you can't freak out and the gorilla
[01:31:45] just
[01:31:46] went wow behind him and he moved out the
[01:31:48] way and just walked past and it was just
[01:31:51] it was that same presence that you're
[01:31:52] feeling that I felt with that's what I
[01:31:54] mean the living being with another
[01:31:55] living being is is spectacular so do you
[01:31:59] think that level of ease comes from the
[01:32:03] helpless nature of being in the presence
[01:32:05] of an animal that could do to you
[01:32:07] whatever they want to like I think part
[01:32:09] of the reason why I felt so calm when
[01:32:11] the whale had come up was because there
[01:32:15] was nothing we could do should it go
[01:32:18] sideways yeah and I think being almost
[01:32:21] finding that kind of inner piece of like
[01:32:24] I've made my mind this is the choices
[01:32:26] I've made I'm here now there's nothing I
[01:32:28] can do it's almost like you should make
[01:32:30] peace with your choices I guess yeah I
[01:32:32] don't know no no no I think that's I
[01:32:34] think you've actually taken it somewhere
[01:32:35] really beautiful m i I think for me as
[01:32:37] well it's humility yeah that's what and
[01:32:39] like when you when you meet someone new
[01:32:41] rarely are we humble sure we we often
[01:32:43] feel the pressure to be like oh look at
[01:32:45] who I am or like you know or we're
[01:32:47] trying to create even if it's not out of
[01:32:49] ego there's a certain sense of like
[01:32:51] wanting to gain people's like and
[01:32:53] respect
[01:32:55] no matter what I do this whale or
[01:32:57] gorilla is not going to like or respect
[01:32:59] me so I just be humble about it and pce
[01:33:02] as you said and it levels you and it
[01:33:03] levels you and it and it allows that
[01:33:05] human being that that being also of
[01:33:07] course it's not you know of course we're
[01:33:09] not re there's no we're not recommending
[01:33:11] that you just go into these
[01:33:13] places yeah but the idea being that I do
[01:33:15] think there's something magical about
[01:33:17] nature where humility is kind of
[01:33:19] Nature's Way MH and it is that what
[01:33:22] you're saying that when you're at peace
[01:33:23] with your choices is and you're at peace
[01:33:25] with here we are here I am I can't do
[01:33:28] anything and guess what it's okay right
[01:33:30] that's what I'm saying yeah it's
[01:33:31] somewhat sort of like I've made a
[01:33:33] decision if the decision is a mistake
[01:33:35] you got to live with it CU you made it I
[01:33:36] guess I want to talk about um Sports cuz
[01:33:38] I was think so I play a lot of tennis
[01:33:39] play a lot of football play a lot of
[01:33:41] pickle ball now you play a l pickle
[01:33:44] because that's that's become a thing but
[01:33:46] but I'm massively more into paddle I
[01:33:48] don't you ever I love paddle tennis I
[01:33:50] love paddle padd tennis is so I want
[01:33:52] that to blow up the us but it's not
[01:33:54] going to so when I went to Dubai and I
[01:33:56] went to Miami and I went to Madrid cuz
[01:33:58] big in Spain M are they playing it here
[01:34:01] yeah my local Tennis Club has got two
[01:34:03] courts and like you can't book them
[01:34:05] they're so sold out all right honestly
[01:34:07] paddle tennis I love tennis yeah I think
[01:34:09] tennis is one of the best sports in the
[01:34:11] world and I think that you know they are
[01:34:13] the highest performing athletes some of
[01:34:15] in the
[01:34:16] world but it's really hard tennis like I
[01:34:19] find unless I'm playing with someone
[01:34:21] who's much better than me I don't play
[01:34:23] well yeah like I really I I need to be
[01:34:25] chasing someone yeah paddle tennis is so
[01:34:28] social it's it's easy to have great
[01:34:31] rallies you still get the the uh the
[01:34:33] satisfaction of really smacking a ball
[01:34:36] cuz pickle is it's all about placement
[01:34:39] and and trying to kind of one up your
[01:34:41] opponent whereas playing at the kitchen
[01:34:42] and just ex why is it called a kitchen I
[01:34:45] have no idea and I that's so I play
[01:34:47] pickle like paddle right cuz I'm I'm
[01:34:49] like no I'm it's nonsense like why I do
[01:34:53] like cool um but paddle tennis padd's
[01:34:56] amazing next time yeah yeah paddle
[01:34:58] paddle one of my favorite favorite I was
[01:35:00] in Dubai with a client for work for
[01:35:02] months a couple of years back I played
[01:35:04] it every day for three months great just
[01:35:07] yeah it's the best workout the most fun
[01:35:09] like time just flew is amazing but I was
[01:35:11] bringing it back to sports because I was
[01:35:13] saying I was saying you know you you
[01:35:15] personally tried to recruit mbappe for
[01:35:18] Tottenham I did yeah and and I just
[01:35:20] thought that was amazing because I was
[01:35:21] like I've never seen this ever happen
[01:35:23] before where you know someone's using
[01:35:25] their clout in the right way listen I
[01:35:27] saw him I'm a mad Tottenham fan and I
[01:35:29] just thought now's my chance and he said
[01:35:32] no the deal didn't go through no signing
[01:35:35] bonus for myself that was a crazy trip
[01:35:38] that going to the Balon door we were
[01:35:40] there for Spider-Man Spider-Man was
[01:35:41] coming out I'm not really sure how that
[01:35:43] was promo for Spider-Man but like it was
[01:35:45] part of our trip for some reason but it
[01:35:48] was amazing meeting these players and
[01:35:50] and I admire them so much it's
[01:35:51] incredible when you can notice other
[01:35:54] athletes and other greatness and I see
[01:35:55] that at the top we talk we've talked a
[01:35:57] lot today about and and you're really
[01:35:58] good at this like you really I feel like
[01:36:00] I feel like you're quite tuned into like
[01:36:03] admiring and observing greatness and
[01:36:06] like the 1% and and trying to figure out
[01:36:08] what they're doing differently and I
[01:36:09] think that's one of the things I've
[01:36:10] definitely seen of the 1% is that
[01:36:12] there's a humility in that they have the
[01:36:14] ability to appreciate other people's
[01:36:17] greatness and skills and values and
[01:36:19] purpose like they're not looking at it
[01:36:21] going I'm the best of all time sure
[01:36:23] there part of them they they may have to
[01:36:24] say that for the cameras or they may
[01:36:26] have to say that before they go on the
[01:36:27] pitch but actually if you talk to them
[01:36:29] and you ask them about someone else
[01:36:31] they'll be like yeah best best player
[01:36:32] I've ever seen like they're incredible
[01:36:34] and so who did you admire growing up in
[01:36:36] acting who do you admire today like who
[01:36:38] have been the people that and maybe on a
[01:36:40] mindset level or maybe on a or or a
[01:36:42] performance level as well there are
[01:36:44] definitely performances of people that I
[01:36:46] look up to there are there are the types
[01:36:47] of careers of certain actors that I
[01:36:49] really admire there are also like the
[01:36:51] the types of lives that certain people
[01:36:54] lead that I really admire and that I
[01:36:55] really aspire to sort of be like um I
[01:36:59] tend to let all of my admiration go
[01:37:03] towards athletes I'm just so blown away
[01:37:06] by what they can do Under the pressure
[01:37:09] that they're under me as an actor I
[01:37:11] realize that my job is a high press job
[01:37:13] because it reaches millions of people
[01:37:17] but that said there are so many people
[01:37:20] that help me get to where I need to be
[01:37:22] MH I get picked up someone makes me
[01:37:24] breakfast someone writes the words that
[01:37:26] I'm supposed to say someone chooses my
[01:37:28] costume someone does my hair and makeup
[01:37:30] someone sets the camera up ultimately I
[01:37:32] walk onto set and I do my bit but I'm a
[01:37:35] small part in a massive machine but when
[01:37:38] you look at someone like jovic or federa
[01:37:40] or you know this new
[01:37:43] alcaraz you or the golfers or or Lewis
[01:37:47] Lewis is slightly different because
[01:37:48] Formula 1 is so much about the team and
[01:37:50] the car and all that sort of stuff they
[01:37:52] have to do it themselves at a certain
[01:37:54] point there's only so much help they can
[01:37:56] get but then when they walk onto that
[01:37:58] court for the first time when they walk
[01:37:59] into the ring or into the octagon it's
[01:38:02] them by themselves they're under that
[01:38:03] amount of pressure it's up to them
[01:38:05] whether they deliver or not and I just
[01:38:06] have always been admiring of seeing some
[01:38:09] of the greats lose their win streak and
[01:38:11] come back even stronger I've always
[01:38:13] really been an admirer of people that
[01:38:15] are able to do that I think it's a Folly
[01:38:17] when you see these win streaks of 50
[01:38:19] and0 and all that sort of stuff and
[01:38:21] you're like well that to me is isn't
[01:38:23] what a champion is a champion is someone
[01:38:25] who had it all lost it all and got it
[01:38:28] right back again Tyson Fury story is a
[01:38:30] crazy one I'd love to see AJ come back
[01:38:33] and be on top again because I'd love to
[01:38:35] be alive to witness that Legacy that he
[01:38:37] would leave behind you know I feel sorry
[01:38:40] for him what happened to him when he
[01:38:41] sort of seemed to really lose it a
[01:38:44] little bit in the ring when he took the
[01:38:45] microphone and I'd love to see him back
[01:38:47] on top and to to have some clarity and
[01:38:50] To Be A Champion again CU I admire him
[01:38:52] as an athlete so I save most of my
[01:38:54] admiration for athletes and musicians I
[01:38:56] love musicians I see someone like Ed
[01:38:58] Sheeran 80,000 people in the palm of his
[01:39:01] hand I think comedians are equally as
[01:39:04] talented the ability that they can just
[01:39:06] go on stage and make people laugh that
[01:39:08] is
[01:39:09] terrifying actors for me because it's
[01:39:11] what I do it's
[01:39:13] like you know yeah yeah I get I get what
[01:39:16] you're saying I get what you're saying
[01:39:17] and and at the end of the day it's just
[01:39:19] it's it's taking what you can from from
[01:39:22] what you Aspire for right like you you
[01:39:23] can take something from all these people
[01:39:25] and and what I love about it some of
[01:39:26] these people you know some of these
[01:39:28] people you don't but I always say to
[01:39:29] people who are listening and watching
[01:39:30] that you can be mentored by people
[01:39:32] you've never met you're right totally
[01:39:34] and I think that's a really important
[01:39:36] skill to gain because I think we live in
[01:39:37] a world right now where somewhat access
[01:39:40] become easier and we always think we
[01:39:42] need access to people directly in order
[01:39:44] to learn from them but you don't know
[01:39:46] everyone you've just mentioned even
[01:39:47] though you may know a couple of them
[01:39:48] closely and and same with me like I was
[01:39:50] really fortunate you know growing up as
[01:39:52] a teenager I got into to like Martin
[01:39:54] Luther King's work and Malcolm X's work
[01:39:55] and I was reading crazy stuff at that
[01:39:58] age but it had a massive impact on my
[01:40:00] mindset I never met all those people and
[01:40:03] obviously would never have got the
[01:40:04] opportunity to do that but I feel
[01:40:06] mentored by them without ever having sat
[01:40:09] in the same room as them because you
[01:40:10] study like how they made decisions and
[01:40:12] you study what they said and what they
[01:40:14] wrote what they stood for what they
[01:40:15] stood for and how and and and the parts
[01:40:17] that you don't hear through history the
[01:40:19] parts that were actually more difficult
[01:40:21] and the parts where they weren't the
[01:40:22] perfect hero right and so all of that
[01:40:25] kind of stuff but Tom before we go to
[01:40:27] the final five you've been so gracious
[01:40:28] with your time today I have to ask you
[01:40:30] if if you want to clarify the Harry Kane
[01:40:31] situation because I'll tell you what the
[01:40:33] reason why I say this is I had the dream
[01:40:35] so I'm a Manchester United Support
[01:40:37] everyone in my community knows that very
[01:40:38] well right uh I have always had the
[01:40:41] dream that Harry Kane when Wayne Rooney
[01:40:45] retired Harry Kane was going to come to
[01:40:47] Manchester United Okay and he was going
[01:40:49] to follow in the footsteps of all the
[01:40:50] great England forwards that have played
[01:40:52] at Manchester
[01:40:53] that didn't happen I'm still holding on
[01:40:56] to that dream but you want him to go
[01:40:58] somewhere else well listen listen let me
[01:41:01] just clarify right I love Harry Kane I
[01:41:03] love humon humon is my favorite football
[01:41:05] player he is a hero I love Tottenham I'm
[01:41:08] a big Tottenham fan but I just I know
[01:41:11] that those players could Thrive and have
[01:41:14] the best careers everwhere else I just
[01:41:17] want to see I want to see Harry lifting
[01:41:19] a trophy and I want to see son there by
[01:41:21] him and and and I just don't think
[01:41:24] you're rooting for the
[01:41:25] individual yeah yeah I'll always be a
[01:41:28] Tottenham fan you know I love being a
[01:41:29] Spurs fan my brother Harry and I you
[01:41:31] know we've really pondered over it but I
[01:41:33] I just you know Harry Kane's one of the
[01:41:34] best strikers in the world and um he
[01:41:37] would fit into almost any team and I'd
[01:41:39] love to see him on top yeah and I
[01:41:41] interesting question do you think he
[01:41:44] would have had a similar season to
[01:41:47] harand had he gone to see oo oh that's
[01:41:51] uh I I personally think CU I think
[01:41:55] harland's amazing I I think Harland with
[01:41:57] his age his strength and his mentality
[01:42:00] you know what's crazy about Harland is I
[01:42:02] saw this interview and you know
[01:42:04] obviously it it hurts me to say it but
[01:42:06] City and all but when Harland did this
[01:42:09] interview he just scored like I can't
[01:42:10] remember which game it was he's
[01:42:12] unbelievable SC he scored like five
[01:42:13] goals that game and he was like I should
[01:42:15] have had seven and and the interview was
[01:42:17] like come on though take some credit
[01:42:18] like you scored five goals and he was
[01:42:20] like yeah I'm I'm happy with that but he
[01:42:22] goes you know there a couple of assists
[01:42:24] that should have gone in and I thought
[01:42:25] that mentality you know that's a
[01:42:27] Winner's mindset that's a Winner's
[01:42:28] mindset I was like he was he knew
[01:42:30] exactly which opportunities he missed
[01:42:31] and I was like so I think it's an AE
[01:42:33] thing I think it's a strength thing I
[01:42:34] feel like harland's kind of like I've
[01:42:36] always compared harand to like Ivan
[01:42:37] Drago like he was made in a lab right
[01:42:39] right right he was made like he was
[01:42:41] manufactured to be this incredible
[01:42:43] talent and think City's good with like
[01:42:45] he he admit like he scores a lot of
[01:42:47] tappins and I think that's his game yeah
[01:42:49] but there's no on a scorecard you know
[01:42:51] in a good way I'm say I'm saying he's
[01:42:53] been built in that way and City play
[01:42:54] that way I don't know if Kane's a
[01:42:55] tapping guy like he his SC his goals
[01:42:58] have generally been a bit more diverse
[01:43:00] in that sense magic yeah magic is the
[01:43:02] way I describe Kane yeah no I I love him
[01:43:05] and obviously it's a typical thing of
[01:43:06] like the Press are out saying oh Tom
[01:43:08] Holland's begging Kane to leave I'm not
[01:43:10] begging him to leave I love that he's at
[01:43:11] our club because I'd be terrified to see
[01:43:13] where we'd be without him but I just
[01:43:15] love to see him have the career I know
[01:43:17] he could have what do you think of Jude
[01:43:18] Bellingham to Madrid I think that's a
[01:43:20] great move I love that just want
[01:43:22] everyone to do love that and what's
[01:43:24] what's interesting is that all of my
[01:43:25] friends in Spain are from Barcelona I
[01:43:27] have one friend from Madrid I've always
[01:43:29] been a big barcel supporter because I
[01:43:31] used to go to Barcelona all the time as
[01:43:32] a kid I had a few weekends where I'd say
[01:43:35] to my mom and dad I'm going to my
[01:43:36] friend's house and I would go to
[01:43:39] Barcelona how did you pull that off man
[01:43:41] just sneaky bro if I told my Indian
[01:43:43] parents that I was like they know the D
[01:43:46] tone straight away I got caught my mom
[01:43:48] called me up and was like where are you
[01:43:50] I was I was trying to say I was on my
[01:43:52] friend's house she said no you're not
[01:43:53] cuz I'm here and I was in Lam Blas in
[01:43:56] Barcelona um but I just I just love
[01:43:58] players I think Jude Bam's amazing and
[01:44:01] you know I just love to see what he
[01:44:03] could do there I think it's the thing
[01:44:04] for me is I love Legacy I love seeing
[01:44:06] what players can do I'm less about the
[01:44:08] teams it's what I love about tennis or
[01:44:10] golf you know it's not about the team
[01:44:12] it's about the player so I would just
[01:44:14] love to see what he could do there and
[01:44:16] you know I'm sure one day we'll see
[01:44:17] England raise a trophy and and we've got
[01:44:19] such a great young team and and um I
[01:44:23] admire them all but yeah I think it's a
[01:44:24] great move for him he's only 19 or
[01:44:26] something like that it's insane yeah
[01:44:28] he's 19 that's wild incredible he's a
[01:44:30] year older than my brother Paddy that's
[01:44:33] mental mate you've been amazing today
[01:44:35] honestly this is yeah this has been some
[01:44:38] of the most fun I've had in a long time
[01:44:40] me too thank you I appreciate it I want
[01:44:41] to ask we ask everyone the final five
[01:44:43] and so these are the fast five questions
[01:44:45] which means answers have to be one word
[01:44:47] to one sentence maximum no more than
[01:44:49] that done okay uh and you don't have to
[01:44:52] write or spell them out so so no no no
[01:44:54] problem be a long be a long none of that
[01:44:56] all right so Tom Holland these are your
[01:44:58] final five uh question one what is the
[01:45:00] best advice you've ever received to turn
[01:45:03] your nerves into excitement I like that
[01:45:06] that we've never had that on the show I
[01:45:07] love that all right second question what
[01:45:09] is the worst advice you've ever received
[01:45:11] move to LA get a marijuana license and
[01:45:13] buy a hot tub who told you that Mark
[01:45:17] wber that's brilliant no he told me that
[01:45:19] honor chat shows I don't know if that
[01:45:21] was legit advice but I didn't take his
[01:45:23] advice okay good well who would you have
[01:45:26] been if you took that advice who knows
[01:45:28] who knows know um all right question
[01:45:29] number three what's the first thing you
[01:45:31] do every morning and the last thing you
[01:45:32] do every night make my bed it's the
[01:45:35] first thing I do and the last thing I do
[01:45:37] before I go to bed admittedly is I check
[01:45:39] my emails which I shouldn't do but that
[01:45:41] is what I do yeah it's bad yeah we asked
[01:45:44] that just to make you aware of what you
[01:45:45] need to change I do need to change that
[01:45:47] making my bed is a good start I used to
[01:45:49] never do that and now like my first
[01:45:51] thing I do is I make my bed that's like
[01:45:52] my first challenge of the day it's a
[01:45:54] good it's an easy one to get done
[01:45:57] question four what's something you're
[01:45:58] trying to learn at the moment I'm
[01:46:00] currently taking golf
[01:46:02] lessons and uh we see a trend here it's
[01:46:05] not going very well where where are you
[01:46:07] at at the moment thing is with golf is
[01:46:09] that the golf swing is a very very
[01:46:12] particular thing so in order to get
[01:46:14] better you do have to take quite a few
[01:46:17] steps backwards I've taken maybe 25 sets
[01:46:20] backwards but I will I will benefit from
[01:46:22] it eventually are you doing it every day
[01:46:25] every day not lessons every day but I
[01:46:26] practice every day I've always said that
[01:46:27] to my wife I was like I want to go away
[01:46:29] for a month and I want to get a Traer
[01:46:31] I'm going to play golf every single day
[01:46:33] only way i' yeah that's the only way I
[01:46:35] had a really so one of my clients took
[01:46:36] me to pxg in Arizona which is like this
[01:46:39] beautiful place Bob Parson's place and I
[01:46:41] had a coach there for two days and I was
[01:46:43] like half decent after two days cuz the
[01:46:45] coach was so good yeah and when I got
[01:46:47] back to LA I tried to get a coach and I
[01:46:48] couldn't find a good one and then I had
[01:46:50] a coach that literally he came highly
[01:46:51] recommended but it didn't work out for
[01:46:53] me he he didn't let me take like 0.7 of
[01:46:55] a swing before he gave me feedback and I
[01:46:57] was like I just need to hit a few like I
[01:46:59] need to kind of just and it was like
[01:47:01] every time I was about to hit the board
[01:47:02] be like NOP sure sure sure I was like I
[01:47:04] just need to kind of like get a feel for
[01:47:05] it and so the guy I go to is a guy
[01:47:07] called James Heath okay and he does most
[01:47:10] of his teachings off of feel so it's not
[01:47:13] about numbers it's not about results
[01:47:15] it's more about how do you feel he he
[01:47:18] calls it the feels so like I'm working
[01:47:20] on twisting my hips more in my back
[01:47:21] swing and will say to me how does that
[01:47:23] make you feel like physically where do
[01:47:25] you feel the stretch where do you feel
[01:47:26] the pain where do you feel the pinch
[01:47:28] that's what I need you to feel and I
[01:47:30] coming from a dancers background that's
[01:47:31] a really great way for me to learn
[01:47:33] because everything in dancing is about
[01:47:35] feel yeah um so if you need a great
[01:47:37] teacher in London James Heath is than
[01:47:39] you thank you shout out James Heath yeah
[01:47:41] shout out James Heath Fifth and final
[01:47:43] question if you could create one law
[01:47:46] that everyone else in the world had to
[01:47:47] follow what would it be um I don't know
[01:47:50] I don't know what one law would solve
[01:47:52] the most amount of problems what would
[01:47:55] you say curious I'd probably go to
[01:47:58] something you said earlier if if I'm
[01:48:00] giving a genuine answer like a real
[01:48:01] answer is I really wish there was a Life
[01:48:05] School oh man like I I that would be it
[01:48:08] because I'm not saying that would solve
[01:48:09] all the problems in the world but it
[01:48:11] would set people up and when I say life
[01:48:13] school I mean emotional Mastery I mean
[01:48:16] 100% egoo master I mean the ability to
[01:48:18] be kind and empathetic and vulnerable
[01:48:21] and compassionate and create spaces I
[01:48:23] think a life school that taught you how
[01:48:25] to be non-judgmental and non-critical of
[01:48:27] others without understanding them I
[01:48:29] think that's what I mean by life school
[01:48:31] so not just the like paying taxes and
[01:48:33] bills and stuff but but the Life School
[01:48:35] of like well what if what if we didn't
[01:48:37] have to live in a world where we just
[01:48:39] said everything we wanted to and did
[01:48:40] everything we wanted to and got away
[01:48:42] with it and you know but I think life
[01:48:44] the life lesson for me should be basic
[01:48:47] health and CPR and basic first aid
[01:48:51] training it should be like you said
[01:48:53] creating an environment at school where
[01:48:56] young people feel more comfortable
[01:48:58] talking about themselves what they're
[01:49:00] going through you know things that might
[01:49:03] be happening at home or things that are
[01:49:04] happening at school like I think that
[01:49:06] that would be an amazing way for
[01:49:09] us to be more expressive and more
[01:49:12] comfortable expressing and again like I
[01:49:14] know I keep going back to it but it's
[01:49:15] about what my show is about which is you
[01:49:18] should feel empowered when asking for
[01:49:20] help it should be something that you're
[01:49:21] proud of like you're recognizing that
[01:49:23] you have an issue it might be an
[01:49:25] internal issue it might be an external
[01:49:26] issue but you are seeking help which I
[01:49:29] think is very admirable yeah absolutely
[01:49:31] yeah I do encourage and recommend
[01:49:33] everyone go what's the crowded room I I
[01:49:34] personally loving it with my wife
[01:49:36] honestly like I I barely watch TV shows
[01:49:40] if I'm completely honest and uh it's
[01:49:42] because I I like something that makes me
[01:49:44] think and reflect and you know and
[01:49:47] entertain me at the same time sure and
[01:49:49] and I think it does a brilliant job of
[01:49:51] doing all three like it's gripping I'm
[01:49:53] like trying to figure out what's going
[01:49:54] on next at the same time I'm like it's
[01:49:56] it's amazing watching
[01:49:58] you being able to be this very different
[01:50:02] character to what we know you as and
[01:50:04] that's really impressive so even on like
[01:50:06] even on a performance level I'm like I'm
[01:50:07] forgetting that you are Spider-Man nice
[01:50:10] right like and that's that's that's how
[01:50:11] I watch movies where I'm like can I
[01:50:13] forget who this person is and or are
[01:50:16] they playing a caricature of themselves
[01:50:18] obviously and with you I'm like I don't
[01:50:20] even think to think it's you right right
[01:50:22] right right now I'm talking to you and
[01:50:23] I've been watching the show I'm like oh
[01:50:24] it's not even the same person sure and
[01:50:26] and that is really really impressive on
[01:50:28] a performance standpoint so well thank
[01:50:29] you so much appr on that yeah thank you
[01:50:32] m thank you if you love this episode
[01:50:34] you'll love my interview with Kobe
[01:50:36] Bryant on how to be strategic and
[01:50:39] obsessive to find your purpose our
[01:50:42] children have become less imaginative
[01:50:44] about how to problem solve and parents
[01:50:46] and coaches have become more directive
[01:50:48] and trying to tell them how to behave
[01:50:50] versus teaching them how to behave
